## Open Discussion

Dr.Electron provided an insight into the Github structure and best practices. Outlined the new branches and the workflow for issues and pull requests and provided an overview of the project management system in Github, and how to create a card on the Kanban board and how to convert a card into an issue, for maximising work efficiency.

Team structure was discussed with adamski and phylo heading up content management and control, and dr.electron and jeroen heading up the development management.

IF encouragement for the project has been expressed, with the UI/UX team looking at helping with the main site front-end.

Sebastian will also be supporting the project, helping on the docosaurus side of things, through providing code, support, and theming inputs.

Current progress was discussed and next course of action to be taken from both the content and the development sides of the projct.

Community outreach - content researchers to be invited from the community,
the use of public surveys and questions to market research the project's required functionality and possible suggestions.

Suggestions were made to build in analytics to better ascertain the most functional and lower performing areas of the system to better optimise content and structure in the future.

A future content 'skill level' system was outlined, to provide readers with a visual reference on the level of topic complexity, to make for a better experience when selecting topics, articles, and links. ie one icon = beginner, two = intermediate, three = advanced
