# IOTA wiki Kick-Off Discussion

**Location**: Discord #X-Team Voice Channel
**Date**: Friday, 21-05-21 - 09:00 (CET)

## Info

The general Consensus among the community, IF, and X-Team members is that a central point of reference that can guide people to the information they require will benefit the entire community and eco-system as a whole.

A rough proposal has been drafted up and will be discussed to establish a course of action to move forward with a potential project outline for the wiki.

## Outline

- Intro
- Discussion topics
- Open Discussion

## Attendees

- adamski
- dr.electron
- jvdhout
- davinki
- phylo

## Agenda

- Outline a structured content proposal
- Determine the most suitable development approach
- Prepare a suggested administration hierarchy
- Proposed content sources and editorial management
- Outline possible requirements from X-Teams and IF
- Discuss community user interaction levels

## Open Discussion

Current information is sporadic and not easy to navigate.
Wikipedia page is not easy to manage and update (no control)
Building the wiki will create a centralised entry point to all things IOTA.
The wiki idea has been very successful for other technologies - Polkadot given as an example.
The system would be developed to compliment and provide access to current documentation and information sources.

Outlined content would act as a broad introduction to the various aspects of the IOTA eco-system
Plain English (and translations) to give an easy-to-understand entry to the various topics
A central entry point into the IOTA eco-system that guides readers to more complex and detailed information and docs
Content to be collected and updated from existing sources working with existing projects to create the introductions
(Rough outline of content proposed in previous pdf from adamski)

System design to evolve into an inclusive system for non-dev community involvement.
Initial system to look at introducing a push based md content system, such as hack.md, docusaurus, or similar.
Supported through git repo management for pushes and updates.
Design to follow a simple landing page to guide users to the relative sections, followed with a sidebar/navbar wiki for content.
User access and management to be controlled through github/discord logins.

Administration to be self-contained in the initial stages, with access permissions to X-Team/IF members
Long-term to investigate community involvement and incentivised contribution.
Future DAO proposal for community support to maintain the wiki.
Develop a community driven initiative to build the system.
Collaboration and support from X-Teams and IF will be essential.

Outward discussion on proposal for EDF funding for initial develop - speculative
Discussion about potential to be hosted at wiki.iota.org - speculative
Future gamification and community incentives for contributions - unresolved

Getting community feedback will be essential.
Do we need it? Will people commit? Will the community publicise it?

What is currently missing?
A central entry point to access everything about IOTA - this is what we will build, bringing everything into one place.

## Summary

The meeting concluded on the understanding that an IOTA wiki is a required initiative to help establish an easy point of reference as an entry into information and further reading about the IOTA eco-system. To help establish marketing potential, as well as giving an easy linking system to the various documentation, repos, blogs, and websites that exist.

As a primary goal, a team of community members will start investigating the deveopment solutions for a simple system that can provide a starting point for a more long term endeavour.

Content will be collected and prepared to put together a starting point for the wiki, which can then be demonstrated and further built upon by community members.

Outreach to the IF and X-Teams for possible feedback on the initiative to investigate concerns, support, and any other inputs that may have been overlooked.

Investigate wiki.js, docusarus, or alternatives as possible starting tools for development.
