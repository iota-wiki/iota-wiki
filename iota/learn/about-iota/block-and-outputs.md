# Blocks and Outputs

The Stardust update replaces the concept
of [messages](https://wiki.iota.org/iota.rs/explanations/messages_payloads_and_transactions) for blocks. Much like a
message, a block is a data structure in the Shimmer networks which represents a node in
the [Shimmer Visualizer](https://explorer.shimmer.network/testnet/visualizer/).
