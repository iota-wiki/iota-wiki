Alias addresses play a significant role in decentralized systems, particularly in managing and identifying various assets.
Unlike traditional addresses associated with specific user accounts, Alias addresses are specifically assigned to Alias
and NFT outputs. These outputs have their own unique addresses, enabling them to hold their respective base tokens or
any other native assets. This means that you could transfer ownership of all the assets controlled by the Alias address
by transferring its Alias output.

## Code Example

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString>
<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

The following example will:

1. Instantiate a [`Wallet`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/core/struct.Wallet.html).
2. Get Alice's [`Account`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html) which was
   [created in the first guide](../accounts-and-addresses/create-account.mdx).
3. Sync the account with the node to get the latest transactions by calling the [`Account.sync()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html#method.sync)
   function.
4. Request the account's balance by calling the [`Account.balance()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html#method.balance)
   function.
5. Retrieve the Alias Id of the first [`AliasOutput`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/types/block/output/alias/struct.AliasOutput.html) related to Alice's
   account.
6. Retrieve the Alias' address using the [`Client.alias_id_to_bech32()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/client/core/struct.ClientInner.html#method.alias_id_to_bech32)
   function.
7. Request funds to the `FAUCET_URL` you defined in the `.env` file by calling the [`Client::utils::request_funds_from_faucet`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/client/utils/fn.request_funds_from_faucet.html) function.
