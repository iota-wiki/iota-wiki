When you burn an [NFT](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/develop/explanations/what-is-stardust/tokenization/#non-fungible-tokens-nfts),
you permanently remove it from the ledger state, rendering it unusable and nontransferable. The associated [storage deposit](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/develop/explanations/what-is-stardust/storage-deposit/) will automatically be returned to its original account.

:::warning irreversible

Burning an NFT is irreversible and signifies the destruction of its digital representation and
associated ownership rights.

## Code Example

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString>
<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

The following example will:

1. Instantiate a [`Wallet`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/core/struct.Wallet.html).
2. Get Alice's [`Account`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html) which was
   [created in the first guide](../accounts-and-addresses/create-account.mdx).
3. Sync the account with the node to get the latest transactions by calling the [`Account.sync()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html#method.sync)
   function.
4. Set the `nft_id` as the first NFT in the balance.
5. Print the NFT balance before burning.
6. Burn the NFT by calling the [`Account.burn()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html#method.burn)
   function.
7. Sync the account again, and display the NFT balance after minting.

```rust reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/blob/develop/sdk/examples/how_tos/nfts/burn_nft.rs
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript-node" label="Typescript (Node.js)">

The following example will:

1. Instantiate a [`Wallet`](../../references/nodejs/classes/Wallet).
2. Get Alice's account which was [created in the first guide](../accounts-and-addresses/create-account.mdx).
3. Sync the account with the node to get the latest transactions by calling the [`Account.sync()`](../../references/nodejs/classes/Account/#sync)
   function.
4. Set `nftId` as the first NFT Id in the balance and display the balance.
5. Prepare the transaction that will burn the NFT by calling the [`Account.prepareBurnNft()`](../../references/nodejs/classes/Account/#prepareburnnft) function.
6. Send the transaction using the [`Account.send()`](../../references/nodejs/classes/Account/#send)
   function.
7. Sync the account again, and display the NFT balance after minting.

```typescript reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/blob/develop/bindings/nodejs/examples/how_tos/nfts/burn_nft.ts
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

The following example will:

1. Instantiate a [`Wallet`](../../references/python/iota_sdk/wallet/).
2. Get Alice's account which was [created in the first guide](../accounts-and-addresses/create-account.mdx).
3. Sync the account with the node to get the latest transactions by calling the [`Account.sync()`](../../references/python/iota_sdk/wallet/account/#sync)
   function.
4. Set `nftId` as the first NFT Id in the balance and display the balance.
5. Prepare the transaction that will burn the NFT by calling the [`Account.prepare_burn_nft()`](../../references/python/iota_sdk/wallet/account/#prepare_burn_nft) function.
6. Send the prepared transaction using the [`Account.send()`](../../references/python/iota_sdk/wallet/account/#send)
   function.

```python reference

```

## Expected Output

```bash
