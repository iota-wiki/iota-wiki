Sending an [NFT](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/develop/explanations/what-is-stardust/tokenization/#non-fungible-tokens-nfts)
allows you to transfer ownership of the unique digital asset to another user. By sending an NFT you grant the new owner full control and possession of the token, including its
associated collectible or token value and any other attributes it defines.

## Code Example

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString>
<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

The following example will:

1. Instantiate a [`Wallet`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/core/struct.Wallet.html).
2. Get Alice's [`Account`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html) which was
   [created in the first guide](../accounts-and-addresses/create-account.mdx).
3. Sync the account with the node to get the latest transactions by calling the [`Account.sync()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html#method.sync)
   function.
4. Set `nft_id` as the first NFT Id in the balance.
5. Define the outputs for the transaction as the [`SendNftParams`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/struct.SendNftParams.html).
6. Send the NFT transaction using the [`Account.send_nft()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/struct.SendNftParams.html) function.

```rust reference

```

<TabItem value="typescript-node" label="Typescript (Node.js)">

The following example will:

1. Instantiate a [`Wallet`](../../../references/nodejs/classes/Wallet).
2. Get Alice's account which was [created in the first guide](../accounts-and-addresses/create-account.mdx).
3. Sync the account with the node to get the latest transactions by calling the [`Account.sync()`](../../../references/nodejs/classes/Account/#sync)
   function.
4. Set `nftId` as the first NFT Id in the balance.
5. Define the outputs for the transaction as the [`SendNftParams`](https://wiki.iota.org/next/iota-sdk/references/nodejs/interfaces/SendNftParams/).
6. Prepare the transaction that will send the NFT using the [`Account.prepareSendNft()`](https://wiki.iota.org/next/iota-sdk/references/nodejs/classes/Account/#preparesendnft) function.
7. Send the transaction using the [`Account.send()`](https://wiki.iota.org/next/iota-sdk/references/nodejs/classes/Account/#send)
   function.

```typescript reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/blob/develop/bindings/nodejs/examples/how_tos/nfts/send_nft.ts
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

The following example will:

1. Instantiate a [`Wallet`](../../../references/python/iota_sdk/wallet/).
2. Get Alice's account which was [created in the first guide](../accounts-and-addresses/create-account.mdx).
3. Sync the account with the node to get the latest transactions by calling the [`Account.sync()`](../../../references/python/iota_sdk/wallet/account/#sync)
   function.
4. Create the `SendNFTParams` setting `nft_id` as the first NFT Id in the balance.
5. Prepare the transaction that will mint the NFT using the [`Account.prepare_send_nft()`](https://wiki.iota.org/next/iota-sdk/references/python/iota_sdk/wallet/account/#prepare_send_nft)
   function.
6. Send the prepared transaction using the [`Account.send()`](https://wiki.iota.org/next/iota-sdk/references/python/iota_sdk/wallet/account/#send)
   function.

```python reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/blob/develop/bindings/python/examples/how_tos/nfts/send_nft.py
```

```bash
