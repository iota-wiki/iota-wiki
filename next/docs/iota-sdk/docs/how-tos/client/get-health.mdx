Checking a node's health status gives you valuable information about the reliability and stability of the node, which
can be crucial for various reasons. By monitoring a node's health status, you can ensure the node is functioning
properly, maintaining a consistent connection to the network, and actively participating in validating transactions. You
can use this information to make informed decisions about which nodes to trust for reliable data, assess network
performance, and ensure the integrity of their interactions within the network.

## Example Code

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString>
<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

The following code example will:

1. Create a [`Client`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/client/core/struct.Client.html) that will connect to the
   node defined in your `.env` file's `NODE_URL` variable.
2. Use the created client to get the health of the specified url using the
   [`Client.get_health()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/client/core/struct.Client.html#method.get_health)
   function.
3. Print the information to the console.

```rust reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/blob/develop/sdk/examples/how_tos/client/get_health.rs
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript-node" label="Typescript (Node.js)">

The following code example will:

1. Create a [`Client`](../../references/nodejs/classes/Client/) that will connect to the
   node defined in your `.env` file's `NODE_URL` variable.
2. Use the created client to get the health of the specified url using the
   [`Client.getHealth()`](../../references/nodejs/classes/Client/#gethealth)
   function.
3. Print the information to the console.

```typescript reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/blob/develop/bindings/nodejs/examples/how_tos/client/get-health.ts
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

The following code example will:

1. Create a [`Client`](../../references/python/iota_sdk/client/) that will connect to the
   node defined in your `.env` file's `NODE_URL` variable.
2. Use the created client to get the health of the specified url using the
   [`Client.get_health()`](../../references/python/iota_sdk/client/_node_core_api/#get_health)
   function.
3. Print the information to the console.

```python reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/blob/develop/bindings/python/examples/how_tos/client/get_health.py
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Expected Output

```bash
Healthy: true
```
