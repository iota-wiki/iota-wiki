After you have [created an account](./create-account.mdx), you have a single address in the account. But you can generate more addresses.

<TipAccountApproaches />

## Code Example

The following example will:

1. Create a wallet.
2. Get Alice's account which was [created in the first guide](create-account.mdx).
3. Generate an address in Alice's account.
