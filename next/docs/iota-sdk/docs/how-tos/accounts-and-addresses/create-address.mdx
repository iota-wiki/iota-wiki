After you have [created an account](./create-account.mdx), you have a single address in the account. This should be
enough for one user using
the [single-account model](../../explanations/accounts-and-addresses.md#single-account-model). However, if you want to use
the [multi-account-account model](../../explanations/accounts-and-addresses.md#single-account-model), you will need to
generate an address for each user in this account.

## Code Example

The following example will:

1. Create a wallet.
2. Get Alice's account which was [created in the first guide](create-account.mdx).
3. Generate an address in Alice's account.
