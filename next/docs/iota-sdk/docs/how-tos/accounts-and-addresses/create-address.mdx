After you have [created an account](./create-account.mdx), you have a single address in the account. This should be
enough for one user using
the [single-account model](../../explanations/accounts-and-addresses.md#single-account-model). However, if you want to use
the [multi-account-account model](../../explanations/accounts-and-addresses.md#single-account-model), you will need to
generate an address for each user in this account.

## Code Example

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString>
<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

The following example will:

1. Instantiate a [`Wallet`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/core/struct.Wallet.html).
2. Get Alice's [`Account`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html) which was
   [created in the first guide](./create-account.mdx).
3. Generate an [`AccountAddress`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/types/struct.AccountAddress.html)
   in Alice's account by calling the
   [`Account.generate_ed25519_addresses()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html#method.generate_ed25519_addresses)
   function.

```rust reference

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript-node" label="Typescript (Node.js)">

The following example will:

1. Instantiate a [`Wallet`](../../../references/nodejs/classes/Wallet).
2. Get Alice's [`Account`](../../../references/nodejs/classes/Account) which was
   [created in the first guide](./create-account.mdx).
3. Generate an [`Address`](../../../references/nodejs/classes/Address/) in Alice's account by calling the
   [`Account.generateEd25519Addresses()`](../../../references/nodejs/classes/Account/#generateed25519addresses) function.

```typescript reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/blob/develop/bindings/nodejs/examples/how_tos/accounts_and_addresses/create-address.ts
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

The following example will:

1. Instantiate a [`Wallet`](../../../references/python/iota_sdk/wallet/).
2. Get Alice's [`Account`](../../../references/python/iota_sdk/wallet/account/) which was
   [created in the first guide](./create-account.mdx).
3. Generate an [`Address`](../../../references/python/iota_sdk/types/address/) in Alice's account by calling the
   [`Account.generate_ed25519_addresses()`](../../../references/python/iota_sdk/wallet/account/#generate_ed25519_addresses) function.

```python reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/blob/develop/bindings/python/examples/how_tos/accounts_and_addresses/create_address.py
```
