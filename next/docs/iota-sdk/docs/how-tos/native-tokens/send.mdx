After you have [created](create.mdx) a
[native token](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/introduction/explanations/what_is_stardust/tokenization#native-tokens),
you can easily send it by calling the `Account.send_native_tokens(params, options)` function.

As with any output, you can set [output unlock conditions](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/introduction/explanations/what_is_stardust/unlock_conditions).
Keep in mind that if you set unlock conditions, whoever you send the native tokens to may need to
claim them.

## Code Example

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString>
<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

The following example will:

1. Instantiate a [`Wallet`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/core/struct.Wallet.html).
2. Get Alice's [`Account`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html) which was
   [created in the first guide](../accounts-and-addresses/create-account.mdx).
3. Sync the account with the node to get the latest transactions by calling the [`Account.sync()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html#method.sync)
   function.
4. Search the account's balance for a native token with a balance of at least `SEND_NATIVE_TOKEN_AMOUNT`.
5. Display the balance before sending.
6. Prepare the outputs for the transaction by creating a new [`SendNativeTokensParams`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/struct.SendNativeTokensParams.html).
7. Send the native tokens by calling the [`account.send_native_tokens()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html#method.send_native_tokens)
   function.
8. Sync the account again, and display the native token balance after sending.

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript-node" label="Typescript (Node.js)">

The following example will:

1. Instantiate a [`Wallet`](../../../references/nodejs/classes/Wallet).
2. Get Alice's account which was [created in the first guide](../accounts-and-addresses/create-account.mdx).
3. Sync the account with the node to get the latest transactions by calling the [`Account.sync()`](../../../references/nodejs/classes/Account/#sync)
   function.
4. Search the account's balance for a native token with a balance of at least `SEND_NATIVE_TOKEN_AMOUNT`.
5. Prepare the outputs for the transaction by creating a new [`SendNativeTokensParams`](https://wiki.iota.org/next/iota-sdk/references/nodejs/interfaces/SendNativeTokensParams/).
6. Display the balance before sending.
7. Prepare the transaction that will send the tokens using the [`Account.prepareSendNativeTokens()`](https://wiki.iota.org/next/iota-sdk/references/nodejs/classes/Account/#preparesendnativetokens)
   function.
8. Send the prepared transaction using the [`Account.send()`](https://wiki.iota.org/next/iota-sdk/references/nodejs/classes/Account/#send)
   function.
9. Sync the account again, and display the native token balance after sending.

```typescript reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/blob/develop/bindings/nodejs/examples/how_tos/native_tokens/send.ts
```

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

The following example will:

1. Instantiate a [`Wallet`](../../../references/python/iota_sdk/wallet/).
2. Get Alice's account which was [created in the first guide](../accounts-and-addresses/create-account.mdx).
3. Sync the account with the node to get the latest transactions by calling the [`Account.sync()`](../../../references/python/iota_sdk/wallet/account/#sync)
   function.
4. Display the balance before sending.
5. Define the outputs for the transaction that will send the tokens by creating the `SendNativeTokensParams`.
6. Prepare the transaction that will send the tokens using the [`Account.prepare_send_native_tokens()`](https://wiki.iota.org/next/iota-sdk/references/python/iota_sdk/wallet/account/#prepare_send_native_tokens)
   function.
7. Send the prepared transaction using the [`Account.send()`](https://wiki.iota.org/next/iota-sdk/references/python/iota_sdk/wallet/account/#send)
   function.
8. Sync the account again, and display the native token balance after minting.
