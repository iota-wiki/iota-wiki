If at any point you want to disable the production of your
[native token](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/introduction/explanations/ledger/foundry), you should destroy the foundry.
However, you can only destroy a foundry output as long as its circulating native token supply is zero.

<DestroyFoundry />

## Code Example

Before you run the example you should make sure the first foundry on your account has zero circulating supply. If you
have no available foundries, you can create one by [creating a native token](create.mdx). If you've already created your
tokens but need to empty the foundry, you can decrease your native token supply by [melting them](melt.mdx).

The following example will:

1. Instantiate a [`Wallet`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/core/struct.Wallet.html), get Alice's `Account` which was
   [created in the first guide](../accounts-and-addresses/create-account.mdx) and [sync it](../accounts-and-addresses/check-balance.mdx).
2. Search the account's balance for a foundry.
3. Display the number of foundries in the balance before destroying.
4. Burn the foundry by calling the [`Account.burn()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html#method.burn)
   function.
5. Display the number of foundries in the balance after destroying.

3. Display the number of foundries in the balance before destroying.
4. Prepare the transaction that will burn the tokens using the [`Account.prepareDestroyFoundry()`](../../references/nodejs/classes/Account/#preparedestroyfoundry)
   function.
5. Send the prepared transaction using the [`Account.send()`](../../references/nodejs/classes/Account/#send)
   function.
6. Sync the account again, and display the number of foundries in the balance after destroying.
