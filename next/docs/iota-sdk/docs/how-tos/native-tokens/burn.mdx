Burning native tokens refers to the permanent removal or destruction of those tokens from circulation. It renders the
tokens unusable and reduces their total supply, often done to maintain scarcity, increase the value of remaining tokens,
or enforce specific rules within an ecosystem.

## Code Example

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString>
<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

The following example will:

1. Instantiate a [`Wallet`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/core/struct.Wallet.html).
2. Get Alice's [`Account`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html) which was
   [created in the first guide](../accounts-and-addresses/create-account.mdx).
3. Sync the account with the node to get the latest transactions by calling the [`Account.sync()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html#method.sync)
   function.
4. Search the account's balance for a native token with a balance of at least `BURN_AMOUNT`.
5. Display the balance before burning.
6. Burn the native tokens by calling the [`Account.burn()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html#method.burn)
   function.
7. Sync the account again, and display the native token balance after burning.

```rust reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/blob/develop/sdk/examples/how_tos/native_tokens/burn.rs
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript-node" label="Typescript (Node.js)">

The following example will:

1. Instantiate a [`Wallet`](../../references/nodejs/classes/Wallet).
2. Get Alice's account which was [created in the first guide](../accounts-and-addresses/create-account.mdx).
3. Sync the account with the node to get the latest transactions by calling the [`Account.sync()`](../../references/nodejs/classes/Account/#sync)
   function.
4. Search the account's balance for a native token with a balance of at least `BURN_AMOUNT`.
5. Display the balance before burning.
6. Prepare the transaction that will burn the tokens using the [`Account.prepareBurnNativeToken()`](../../references/nodejs/classes/Account/#prepareburnnativetoken)
   function.
7. Send the prepared transaction using the [`Account.send()`](../../references/nodejs/classes/Account/#send)
   function.
8. Sync the account again, and display the native token balance after burning.

```typescript reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/blob/develop/bindings/nodejs/examples/how_tos/native_tokens/burn.ts
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

The following example will:

1. Instantiate a [`Wallet`](../../references/python/iota_sdk/wallet/).
2. Get Alice's account which was [created in the first guide](../accounts-and-addresses/create-account.mdx).
3. Sync the account with the node to get the latest transactions by calling the [`Account.sync()`](../../references/python/iota_sdk/wallet/account/#sync)
   function.
4. Display the balance before burning.
5. Prepare the transaction that will burn the tokens using the [`Account.prepare_burn_native_token()`](../../references/python/iota_sdk/wallet/account/#prepare_burn_native_token)
   function.
6. Send the prepared transaction using the [`Account.send()`](../../references/python/iota_sdk/wallet/account/#send)
   function.
7. Sync the account again, and display the native token balance after minting.

```

```plaintext
Balance before burning: 30
Transaction sent: 0x8c93b86b003b0476266f1d4d0c486dfcbbb72d4991eb5d63d5466a6cad93e9f2
