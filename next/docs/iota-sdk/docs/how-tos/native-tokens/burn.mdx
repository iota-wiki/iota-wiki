Burning native tokens refers to the permanent removal or destruction of those tokens from circulation. It renders the
tokens unusable and reduces their total supply, often done to maintain scarcity, increase the value of remaining tokens,
or enforce specific rules within an ecosystem.

## Code Example

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString>
<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

The following example will:

1. Instantiate a [`Wallet`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/core/struct.Wallet.html), Get Alice's `Account` which was
   [created in the first guide](../accounts-and-addresses/create-account.mdx) and [sync it](../accounts-and-addresses/check-balance.mdx).
2. Search the account's balance for a native token with a balance of at least `BURN_AMOUNT`.
3. Display the balance before burning.
4. Burn the native tokens by calling the [`Account.burn()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html#method.burn)
   function.
5. Sync the account again, and display the native token balance after burning.

```rust reference

```

The following example will:

   [created in the first guide](../accounts-and-addresses/create-account.mdx) and [sync it](../accounts-and-addresses/check-balance.mdx).
2. Search the account's balance for a native token with a balance of at least `BURN_AMOUNT`.
3. Display the balance before burning.
4. Prepare the transaction that will burn the tokens using the [`Account.prepareBurnNativeToken()`](../../references/nodejs/classes/Account/#prepareburnnativetoken)
   function.
5. Send the prepared transaction using the [`Account.send()`](../../references/nodejs/classes/Account/#send)
   function.
6. Sync the account again, and display the native token balance after burning.

```typescript reference
