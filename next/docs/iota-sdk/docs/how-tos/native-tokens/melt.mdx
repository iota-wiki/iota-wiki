Melting native tokens refers to the process of converting or "melting" them back into their underlying base token. It
allows you to retrieve the original value or utility of the native tokens by exchanging them for their base token
equivalent, providing flexibility in managing tokenized assets within the ecosystem.

:::info
If you melt your native tokens, you can still destroy the foundry that created them.

## Code Example

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString>
<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

The following example will:

1. Instantiate a [`Wallet`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/core/struct.Wallet.html), get Alice's `Account` which was
   [created in the first guide](../accounts-and-addresses/create-account.mdx) and [sync it](../accounts-and-addresses/check-balance.mdx).
2. Display the current native token balance.
3. Melt `MELT_AMOUNT` native tokens by calling the [`Account.melt_native_token()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html#method.melt_native_token)
   function.
4. Display the native token balance after melting.

```rust reference

```

<TabItem value="typescript-node" label="Typescript (Node.js)">

The following example will:

1. Instantiate a [`Wallet`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/core/struct.Wallet.html), get Alice's `Account` which was
   [created in the first guide](../accounts-and-addresses/create-account.mdx) and [sync it](../accounts-and-addresses/check-balance.mdx).
2. Display the current native token balance.
3. Prepare to melt `MELT_AMOUNT` native tokens transaction by calling the [`Account.prepareMeltNativeToken()`](../../references/nodejs/classes/Account/#preparemeltnativetoken)
   function.
4. Send the prepared transaction using the [`Account.send()`](../../references/nodejs/classes/Account/#send)
   function.
5. Display the native token balance after melting.

```typescript reference

## Expected Output

```plaintext
Balance before melting: 100
Transaction sent: 0x7b3b152127d3cf2921891ad1ea279ae484d559e4040a0d3ca8940c89cb64b34e

Balance after melting: 90
