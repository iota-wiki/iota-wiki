# What is Stardust?

Stardust is a comprehensive utility upgrade of the IOTA Chrysalis protocol. The main goals of Stardust upgrade are to:
 - make IOTA an **infrastructure and settlement layer** for [second-layer smart contract chains](https://wiki.iota.org/smart-contracts/overview),
 - transform IOTA into a **multi-asset ledger** with custom, user defined tokens.

The previous IOTA protocol, Chrysalis, is optimized for a single application: sending digital money from A to B.
Stardust makes it possible to program that digital money with any business logic via smart contract chains, furthermore,
you can also print your own unique digital money!

The Chrysalis ledger was redesigned and extended to cater to these goals. In the following, we will go through the new
concepts in detail.
