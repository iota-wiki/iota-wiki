# Roadmap to Decentralization

IOTA's long-awaited Coordicide update will completely decentralize the network.

## What is Coordicide?

Coordicide, also known as IOTA V2, is an upcoming update to IOTA's core protocol that will enable full decentralization for both value and data transfer and will at the same time significantly improve performance on the network.

An overview of the concepts of Coordicide can be found in this video series produced by the IOTA Foundation:

- [Introduction to Coordicide specifications](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMbc46iGTB_SVIdrzYuOBDcDD80co4iSF)

The first implementation of Coordicide is already live: you can learn everything about it on this website:

- [IOTA V2 DEVNET](https://v2.iota.org/)

## When will Coordicide take place?

Although no current roadmap date has been specified, Coordicide has been placed on the official IOTA [roadmap](https://roadmap.iota.org/) which shows the next steps to be taken before completion. You can view the progress of Coordicide [here](https://roadmap.iota.org/coordicide).
