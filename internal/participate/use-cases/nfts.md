## What is a NFT?
A Non-fungile Token (NFT) was first invented by the Ethereum Community and describes as the ERC721 Token standart. The difference to normal tokens and a NFT is that, the NFT is unique and clearly verifiable and can be used to prove ownership of any digital good.

There are many different use cases for NFTs, the most common use case is to link an image to it which becomes unqiue digital art which can be sold on open NFT marketplaces.

Other use cases would be to use NFts as assets in games, for event tickets, for Decentraliced Finance (DeFi), for votings in dezentralced autonomous organisations (DAOs) or for any objects in the Metaverse.

## Different NFT Types on IOTA 

- Layer 1 Assets also known as "Digital Native Assets". With the [IOTA tokenization framework](https://blog.iota.org/tokenization-on-the-tangle-iota-digital-assets-framework/) you can create NFTs on L1 using the NFT output type. Layer 1 NFTs can be transfered on the whole layer without any fees and enable you to transfer NFTs between different smart contract chains.
- Layer 2 Assets are created within Smart Contracts and can be minted out of thin air. That means, you dont need any coins to mint new NFTs.
    - For the Wasm VM, they are ERC721 Standarts implemented in [Rust, Go and Typescript](https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp/tree/develop/contracts/wasm/erc721).
    - EVM Assets (known Ethereum standarts (like ERC721 or ERC1155) can be used in the IOTA Smart Contract EVM Chain. For exanoke, you can use the Open Source library from [OpenZeppelin Smart Contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts).

## NFT Marketplaces

The first IOTA NFT marketplace, was developed by the IOTA community and launched in July 2021 on the IOTA 2.0 DevNet. 

The IOTA NFT marketplace is a feeless alternative to the expensive and energy-wasting approaches taken by other networks.

Their tests phase has ended. For the next steps they implement Smart Contracts and integrate Browser Wallets to make the NFT trading secure and accessible.

## NFT Projects

The community also creates really amazing artworks and already dropping them on the Smart Contrat Testnet. Please note - all these NFTs are on the Testnet, and be careful that some NFT projects might do new drops when the mainnet launches.
