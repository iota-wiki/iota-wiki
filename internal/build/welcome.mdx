Welcome to the IOTA documentation. This is the entry point for developers. With IOTA 1.5, IOTA is becoming production ready, and there is a clear path towards full decentralization with IOTA 2.0.
Partners, academia, and developers can now start to build on the Tangle and plan for the future. There will not be substantial changes on the way to IOTA 2.0, as the majority of the code-base including
tools, libraries, and APIs already exists in IOTA 1.5. Projects built on todayâ€™s codebase will not require major refactoring later on.
If you want to start developing with IOTA Smart Contracts Protocol (ISCP) you need to use the 2.0 network.
