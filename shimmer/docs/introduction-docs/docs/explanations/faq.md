# FAQ

:::warning
TODO: Update for Stardust/Shimmer.
:::

## Which Libraries are Available for Stardust?

## What is Dust Protection and How Does it Work?

## When is a Transaction on the Network Considered Final/Irreversible?

On average, confirmation times on the new network are around 5 seconds. Once a transaction is set to confirm its final transaction, you do not have block confirmations like with blockchain.

## Hornet or Bee? Which Node Software Should I Use?

You can either pick [Bee](https://wiki.iota.org/bee/develop/getting_started/getting_started) (Rust based) or [Hornet](https://wiki.iota.org/hornet/develop/welcome) (Go based). We currently recommend Hornet since it is the most complete version of the node software. Bee is still missing some optional features you might wish to use.
