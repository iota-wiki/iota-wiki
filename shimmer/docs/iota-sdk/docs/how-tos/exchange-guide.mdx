# Stardust Exchange Integration Guide

:::note

The Stardust update is a set of protocol changes that were first deployed to the Shimmer network.
See [What is Stardust?
](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/develop/explanations/what-is-stardust/) for an overview of its features or [TIPs](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips) flagged `Stardust` for a deeper understanding of the protocol changes.

:::

:::warning

The Stardust update allows for complex tokenization schemes that can lead to monetary losses if misused.
Transaction outputs might have multiple unlocking conditions. These conditions may require the return of part or all of the output amounts, have an expiration date if not claimed on time, or they may not be unlockable for an extended period of time. Therefore, you need to review these unlock conditions carefully before accepting any deposits to avoid loss of funds.

## Integration Guide

This guide explains how to integrate the IOTA SDK into your exchange, custody solution, or product.

Features of the IOTA SDK:

- Secure seed management.
- Account management with multiple accounts and multiple addresses.
- Confirmation monitoring.
- Deposit address monitoring.
- Backup and restore functionality.

### How Does It Work?

The IOTA SDK is a stateful library which provides an API for developers to build value transaction applications. It offers abstractions to handle payments and can optionally interact with [Stronghold](https://wiki.iota.org/stronghold.rs/getting_started) for seed handling, seed storage, and state backup.

:::note

If you are unfamiliar with the IOTA SDK, you can find more information in the [documentation](../welcome.md).

:::

You can use the following examples as a guide to implementing _the multi-account approach_ using the `NodeJs` bindings:

1. [Set up the IOTA SDK](#1-set-up-the-iota-sdk).
2. [Create an account for each user](#2-create-an-account-for-each-user).
3. [Generate a user address to deposit funds](#3-generate-a-user-address-to-deposit-funds).
4. [Check the user balance](#4-check-the-account-balance).
5. [Listen to events](#5-listen-to-events).
6. [Enable withdrawals](#6-enable-withdrawals).

:::note

If you are looking for other languages, please read the [IOTA SDK overview](../welcome/#your-application-in-the-iota-network).

:::

Since all IOTA SDK bindings are based on core principles provided by the IOTA SDK, the outlined approach is very similar regardless of your chosen programming language.

<details>
<summary> If you were already supporting Shimmer with wallet.rs </summary>

The [IOTA SDK](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk) is a brand new project which is a combination and improvement of both [iota.rs](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs) and [wallet.rs](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs).
If you were already supporting Shimmer with wallet.rs, we encourage you to switch to the SDK as wallet.rs will be deprecated and not receive any updates anymore.

Most of the APIs are the same and the changes are fairly minimal, here are some of the major changes:

- The npm package changes from `@iota/wallet` to `@iota/sdk`
- `AccountManager` becomes `Wallet`
- `manager.generateMnemonic()` becomes `Utils.generateMnemonic()`
- `generateAddress` becomes `generateEd25519Addresses`
- `sendAmount` becomes `send`
- The callbacks to `listen` now provide a properly typed `Event`

</details>

### 1. Set Up the IOTA SDK

First, you should install the components needed to use the IOTA SDK and the binding of your choice; it may vary a bit from language to language. In case of the [NodeJs binding](../getting-started/nodejs.mdx), it is straightforward since it is distributed via the `npm` package manager.

You can read more about [backup and security in this guide](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/introduction/how_tos/backup_security).

```bash
npm install @iota/sdk dotenv
```

:::warning

We use `dotenv` to share user-defined constants, like database paths, node URLs, and wallet credentials across many examples. This is for convenience only and shouldn't be done in production.

:::

You can create a `.env` by running the following command:

```bash
touch .env
```

The following examples will need these variables to exist, here are some default values you can use but also change:

```bash
WALLET_DB_PATH="./wallet-database"
NODE_URL="https://api.testnet.shimmer.network"
STRONGHOLD_SNAPSHOT_PATH="./wallet.stronghold"
STRONGHOLD_PASSWORD="*K6%79#yeFn7AMQhMQ"
EXPLORER_URL="https://explorer.shimmer.network/testnet"
```

#### 1 Generate a mnemonic

```js reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/tree/develop/bindings/nodejs/examples/exchange/0-generate-mnemonic.ts
```

After you have updated the `.env` file, you can initialize the `Wallet` instance with a secret manager([`Stronghold`](https://wiki.iota.org/stronghold.rs/welcome) by default) and client options.

:::note

Manage your password with the utmost care.

:::

By default, the Stronghold file will be called `wallet.stronghold`. It will store the seed (derived from the mnemonic) that serves as a cryptographic key from which all accounts and related addresses are generated.

One of the key principles behind `Stronghold` is that is impossible to extract a mnemonic from it ever again, that is, recover it from the `.stronghold` file. That's why you should always back up your 24-word mnemonic and have it stored in safe place. You deal with accounts using the `Wallet` instance exclusively, which abstracts away all internal complexities and makes transacting in a network very easy and convenient.

:::note

Keep the `stronghold` password and the `stronghold` database on separate devices. See the [backup and security guide](https://wiki.iota.org/introduction/how_tos/backup_security/) for more information.

:::

#### 2 Create an Account for Each User

You can import the IOTA SDK and create a wallet using the following example:

```js reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/tree/develop/bindings/nodejs/examples/exchange/1-create-account.ts
```

The `Alias` must be unique and can be whatever fits your use case. The `Alias` is typically used to identify an account later on. Each account is also represented by an `index`, which is incremented by one every time a new account is created. You can refer to any account via its `index` or its `alias`.

You get an instance of any created account using `Wallet.getAccount(accountId|alias)` or get all accounts with `Wallet.getAccounts()`.

Common methods of an `Account` instance include:

- `account.addresses()` - returns a list of addresses related to the account.
- `account.generateEd25519Addresses()` - generates one or more new address(es) for the address index incremented by 1.
- `account.balance()` - returns the balance for the given account.
- `account.sync()` - sync the account information with the Tangle.

### 3. Generate a User Address to Deposit Funds

The `wallet` module of the IOTA SDK is a stateful library. This means it caches all relevant information in storage to provide performance benefits while dealing with, potentially, many accounts and addresses.

```js reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/tree/develop/bindings/nodejs/examples/exchange/2-generate-address.ts
```

Every account can have multiple addresses. Addresses are represented by an `index` which is incremented by one every time a new address is created. You can access the addresses using the `account.addresses()` method:

```javascript
const addresses = account.addresses();

console.log('Need a refill? Send it to this address:', addresses[0]);
```

You can use the [Faucet](https://faucet.testnet.shimmer.network/) to request test tokens and test your account.

There are two types of addresses, `internal` and `public` (external). This approach is known as a _BIP32 Hierarchical Deterministic wallet (HD Wallet)_.

- Each set of addresses is independent of each other and has an independent `index` id.
- Addresses that are created by `account.generateEd25519Addresses()` are indicated as `internal=false` (public).
- Internal addresses (`internal=true`) are called `change` addresses and are used to send the excess funds to them.

### 4. Check the Account Balance

<WarningUnlockConditions />

You can get the available account balance across all addresses of the given account using the following example:

```js reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/tree/develop/bindings/nodejs/examples/exchange/3-check-balance.ts
```

### 5. Listen to Events

<WarningUnlockConditions />

The IOTA SDK supports several events for listening. A provided callback is triggered as soon as an event occurs (which usually happens during syncing).

You can use the following example to listen to new output events:

```js reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/tree/develop/bindings/nodejs/examples/exchange/4-listen-events.ts
```

**Example output:**

```js
NewOutput: {
  output: {
    outputId: '0x2df0120a5e0ff2b941ec72dff3464a5b2c3ad8a0c96fe4c87243e4425b9a3fe30000',
    metadata: [Object],
    output: [Object],
    isSpent: false,
    address: [Object],
    networkId: '1862946857608115868',
    remainder: false,
    chain: [Array]
  },
  transaction: null,
  transactionInputs: null
}
```

Alternatively you can use `account.outputs()` to get all outputs that are stored in the account, or `account.unspentOutputs()`, to get only unspent outputs.

### 6. Enable Withdrawals

You can use the following example to send tokens to an address.

```js reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/tree/develop/bindings/nodejs/examples/exchange/5-send-amount.ts
```

The full function signature is `account.send(amount, address[, options])`.

Default options are fine and successful; however, you can provide additional options, such as `remainderValueStrategy`, which can have the following values:

- `changeAddress`: Send the remainder value to an internal address.
- `reuseAddress`: Send the remainder value back to its original address.
- `customAddress`: Send the remainder value back to a provided account address.

```js
TransactionOptions {
    remainderValueStrategy?: RemainderValueStrategy;
    taggedDataPayload?: TaggedDataPayload;
    customInputs?: string[];
}
```

The `account.send()` function returns a `transaction` with its id. The `blockId` can be used later for checking the confirmation status. You can obtain individual transactions related to the given account using the `account.transactions()` function.

`account.sendWithParams()` can be used to send to multiple addresses in a single transaction.

:::note Dust Protection

When sending tokens, you should consider a [dust protection](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/tips/tips/TIP-0019) mechanism.
