# Smart Contract State

The smart contract state storage on the host consists of a single key/value map. Both key
and value are raw data bytes. As long as you access the data in the same way that you used
to store it, you will always get valid data back. The [Schema Tool](usage.mdx) will create
a type-safe access layer to make sure that data storage and retrieval always uses the
expected data type.

The `state` section in the schema definition file contains a number of field definitions
that together define the variables that are stored in the state storage. Each field
definition uses a YAML key/value pair to define the name and data type of the field. The
YAML key defines the field name. The YAML value (a string) defines the field's data type,
and can be followed by an optional comment that describes the field.

The [Schema Tool](usage.mdx) will use this information to generate the specific code that
accesses the state variables in a type-safe way. Let's examine the `state` section of the
`dividend` example in more detail:

<Tabs groupId="schema" queryString>
<TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">

```yaml
state:
  memberList: Address[] # array with all the recipients of this dividend

  # factors per member

  members: map[Address]Uint64 # map with all the recipient factors of this dividend
  owner: AgentID # owner of contract, the only one who can call 'member' func
  totalFactor: Uint64 # sum of all recipient factors
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Let's start with the simplest state variables. `totalFactor` is an Uint64, and `owner` is
an AgentID. Both are predefined [WasmLib value types](../wasm_vm/types.mdx).

Then you have the `memberList` variable. The empty brackets `[]` indicate that this is an
array. The brackets immediately follow the homogenous type of the elements in the array,
which in this case is the predefined Address value type.

Finally, you have the `members` variable. The `map[]` indicates that this is a map.
Between the brackets is the homogenous type of the keys, which in this case are of the
predefined Address type. The brackets are immediately followed by the homogenous type of
the values in the map, which in this case are of the predefined Uint64 type.

Here is part of the corresponding code in `state.xx` that the [Schema Tool](usage.mdx)
generates. The `MutableDividendState` struct defines a type-safe interface to access each
of the state variables through mutable proxies:

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString>

<TabItem value="go" label="Go">

```go
type MutableDividendState struct {
	proxy wasmtypes.Proxy
}

func (s MutableDividendState) AsImmutable() ImmutableDividendState {
	return ImmutableDividendState(s)
}

// array with all the recipients of this dividend
func (s MutableDividendState) MemberList() ArrayOfMutableAddress {
	return ArrayOfMutableAddress{proxy: s.proxy.Root(StateMemberList)}
}

// map with all the recipient factors of this dividend
func (s MutableDividendState) Members() MapAddressToMutableUint64 {
	return MapAddressToMutableUint64{proxy: s.proxy.Root(StateMembers)}
}

// owner of contract, the only one who can call 'member' func
func (s MutableDividendState) Owner() wasmtypes.ScMutableAgentID {
	return wasmtypes.NewScMutableAgentID(s.proxy.Root(StateOwner))
}

// sum of all recipient factors
func (s MutableDividendState) TotalFactor() wasmtypes.ScMutableUint64 {
	return wasmtypes.NewScMutableUint64(s.proxy.Root(StateTotalFactor))
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct MutableDividendState {
	pub(crate) proxy: Proxy,
}

impl MutableDividendState {
    pub fn as_immutable(&self) -> ImmutableDividendState {
		ImmutableDividendState { proxy: self.proxy.root("") }
	}

    // array with all the recipients of this dividend
    pub fn member_list(&self) -> ArrayOfMutableAddress {
		ArrayOfMutableAddress { proxy: self.proxy.root(STATE_MEMBER_LIST) }
	}

    // map with all the recipient factors of this dividend
    pub fn members(&self) -> MapAddressToMutableUint64 {
		MapAddressToMutableUint64 { proxy: self.proxy.root(STATE_MEMBERS) }
	}

    // owner of contract, the only one who can call 'member' func
    pub fn owner(&self) -> ScMutableAgentID {
		ScMutableAgentID::new(self.proxy.root(STATE_OWNER))
	}

    // sum of all recipient factors
    pub fn total_factor(&self) -> ScMutableUint64 {
		ScMutableUint64::new(self.proxy.root(STATE_TOTAL_FACTOR))
	}
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="Typescript">

```ts
export class MutableDividendState extends wasmtypes.ScProxy {
  asImmutable(): sc.ImmutableDividendState {
    return new sc.ImmutableDividendState(this.proxy);
  }

  // array with all the recipients of this dividend
  memberList(): sc.ArrayOfMutableAddress {
    return new sc.ArrayOfMutableAddress(this.proxy.root(sc.StateMemberList));
  }

  // map with all the recipient factors of this dividend
  members(): sc.MapAddressToMutableUint64 {
    return new sc.MapAddressToMutableUint64(this.proxy.root(sc.StateMembers));
  }

  // owner of contract, the only one who can call 'member' func
  owner(): wasmtypes.ScMutableAgentID {
    return new wasmtypes.ScMutableAgentID(this.proxy.root(sc.StateOwner));
  }

  // sum of all recipient factors
  totalFactor(): wasmtypes.ScMutableUint64 {
    return new wasmtypes.ScMutableUint64(this.proxy.root(sc.StateTotalFactor));
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

As you can see, the schema tool has generated a proxy interface for the mutable `dividend`
state, called `MutableDividendState`. It has a 1-to-1 correspondence to the `state`
section in the schema definition file. Each member function accesses a type-safe proxy
object for the corresponding variable. In addition, the [Schema Tool](usage.mdx) generates
any necessary intermediate map and array proxy types that force the usage of their
respective homogenous types. In the above example both `ArrayOfMutableAddress` and
`MapAddressToMutableUint64` are examples of such automatically generated proxy types.
See the full `state.xx` for more details.

In the next section we will explore how the [Schema Tool](usage.mdx) helps to simplify
[triggering events](events.mdx).
