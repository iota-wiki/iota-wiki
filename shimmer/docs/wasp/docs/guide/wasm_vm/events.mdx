# Triggering Events

Smart contracts do not live in a vacuum. Even though they run in a very limited sandbox,
from a larger perspective there will have to be a way for users to interact with them.
Since smart contracts are essentially event-driven, and requests run asynchronously from
the user's perspective, there is a need for triggering events by the smart contracts
themselves. Of course, it would be possible for users to periodically call a view function
to retrieve the latest state of the smart contract, but this burdens the nodes
unnecessarily. A better way is to have the smart contracts trigger events that the user
can subscribe to and that convey changes to its state.

To support events the ISC sandbox provides only a very rudimentary interface. The
`ScFuncContext` [Call Context](context.mdx) exposes this interface through its `event()`
function, which takes a completely arbitrary text string as parameter. It is up to the
smart contract creator to format this text string in a meaningful way, and it's up to the
user to interpret this text string correctly. This is error-prone, inconsistent, and means
that a lot of code needs to be written both on the smart contract side that generates
these events, and on the client side that handles these events. And with any change to the
formatting of these events both ends need to be modified to stay in sync.

This is why the [Schema Tool](usage.mdx) allows you to define your own structured events.
The [Schema Tool](usage.mdx) will generate a structure that will become part of all Func
function contexts. Events can only be triggered from within a Func. They will become part
of the state of the smart contract because every event is logged in the core `blocklog`
contract. Therefore, events cannot be triggered from within a View.

For each event defined in the `events` section of the schema definition file, this events
structure will contain a member function that takes the defined types of parameters and
will automatically encode the event as a consistently formatted string and pass it to the
`event()` function. The string consists of the name of the event, a timestamp, and string
representations of each field, all separated by vertical bars.

Here is the `events` section that can be found in the demo `fairroulette` smart contract:

<Tabs groupId="schema" queryString>
<TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">

```yaml
events:
  bet:
    address: Address # address of better
    amount: Uint64 # amount of tokens to bet
    number: Uint16 # number to bet on
  payout:
    address: Address # address of winner
    amount: Uint64 # amount of tokens won
  round:
    number: Uint32 # current betting round number
  start:
  stop:
  winner:
    number: Uint16 # the winning number
```

The [Schema Tool](usage.mdx) will generate `events.xx` which contains the following code
for the `FairRouletteEvents` struct:

Notice how the generated functions use the WasmLib EventEncoder to encode the parameters
into a single string before emitting it. Here is the way in which `fairroulette` emits the
`bet` event in its smart contract code:

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString>

<TabItem value="go" label="Go">

```go
    f.Events.Bet(bet.Better.Address(), bet.Amount, bet.Number)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

```rust
    f.events.bet(&bet.better.address(), bet.amount, bet.number);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="Typescript">

```ts
f.events.bet(bet.better.address(), bet.amount, bet.number);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The smart contract client code can define handler functions to listen in to the event
stream and respond to any events it deems noteworthy. The [Schema Tool](usage.mdx) will
automatically generate the necessary client side code that properly listens for the
events, parses the event strings into a type-safe structure, and passes this structure to
the corresponding handler function.

In the next section we will explore how the [Schema Tool](usage.mdx) helps to simplify
smart contract [function definitions](funcs.mdx).
