# Metadata

The _Metadata Feature_ of allows you to store arbitrary data in outputs.
Of course, storing data in outputs increases the minimum base token requirement, but in turn it provides a data storage
option that is available 24/7 on any network node.

As soon as the output with metadata is consumed, it is pruned from nodes' databases and base tokens used as storage
deposit are freed up.
