# Destroy an Alias

When an alias is destroyed, the storage deposit is refunded to a governor defined address. Keep in mind that once the
alias is destroyed, any funds locked in the ledger in outputs that belong to the alias address (derived from _Alias ID_)
are essentially lost, as it is not possible to unlock them.

## Example Transaction

Transaction D shows a governance transition that destroys the alias.
