# Create an Alias

Just like a _Basic Output_, an _Alias Output_ also must have:

- **Amount** to hold base token.
- **Unlock Conditions** that define how the output can be unlocked.
- **Features** that don't modify the unlocking.

On top of these, it also defines:

- **State Index** that has to be incremented in every transaction initiated by the _State Controller_.
- **State Metadata** that may hold binary data.
- **Foundry Counter** that defines how many foundries the alias has created.
- **Immutable Features** that are regular _Features_ defined upon creation which can never be modified afterward.

## Available Unlock Conditions

Alias outputs only support two type of unlock conditions:

- **State Controller Address Unlock Condition** that defines the state controller.
- **Governor Address Unlock Condition** that defines the governor of the alias.

## Example Transaction

Transaction A shows the process of creating a new alias output and hence an alias account. Notice the creation
constraints enforced by the protocol:

- **Alias ID** must be zeroed out. This signals to the protocol that the alias account is new and when the transaction
  confirms, a unique **Alias ID** must be generated.
- **State Index** must be zero as this is the first possible state the alias represents.
- **Foundry Counter** must be zero as the alias doesn't control any foundries yet.
- **Issuer** and **Sender** addresses must be unlocked in the transaction if present.

When _Alias Output #1_ from Transaction A is consumed in a subsequent transaction, the _Alias ID_ field in the
transitioned alias must be set to the protocol generated unique identifier, which is the Blake2b-256 hash of the
_Output ID_ of _Alias Output #1_.
