# Composability in a Multi-Chain Environment with Shimmer Network

:::note tl;dr;
The Shimmer network enables full customization of smart contract chains while retaining interoperability and composability between them, allowing for near limitless capacity and horizontal scaling.

## Tailoring Smart Contract Chains to Your Needs

With the Shimmer network, you can customize every aspect of your smart contract chain, including virtual machines, smart contract types, languages, consensus models, validators, fees, and more. The only requirement to maintain composability and interoperability between chains is adherence to a common data model for anchoring. This flexibility allows you to create a truly interconnected multi-chain environment.

### Why Interoperability and Composability Matter

#### Increased Throughput

Today's smart contract chains have limited capacity, usually between 5-25 transactions per second. This can lead to demand outpacing capacity, resulting in bidding wars for fees or clogged chains. Horizontal scaling, or adding more chains, is a quick fix to increase throughput. However, this introduces challenges for frictionless interoperability and composability between chains.

By committing state changes of smart contracts feelessly to the Shimmer network, chaining of smart contracts becomes possible, allowing the result of one execution to be used as input for another. This property, known as "composability," enables seamless interaction between smart contracts across chains.

The Shimmer network acts as the connecting tissue between all chains anchored to it, providing a feeless, composable, and fully interoperable multi-chain environment processed in parallel. These features are unmatched in the current DLT landscape, opening up exciting new possibilities for their use.
