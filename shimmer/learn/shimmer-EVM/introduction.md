# What is Shimmer EVM?

:::note tl;dr;

Shimmer EVM is an innovative smart contract chain on the Shimmer network, providing an unmatched combination of
scalability, composability, and interoperability for a seamless multi-chain experience.

:::

[Shimmer EVM](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/smart-contracts/guide/evm/introduction/) is a groundbreaking addition to the
IOTA ecosystem that brings unparalleled scalability, composability, and
interoperability to the smart contract landscape. As the first fully EVM-compatible smart contract chain on the Shimmer
network, it overcomes major drawbacks in existing blockchain solutions and offers higher utility by an order of
magnitude.

## The Significance of Parallelization in the Shimmer Network

One of the defining features of the Shimmer network is its parallelized nature, made possible by its use of a [directed
acyclic graph (DAG)](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/learn/tangle/) instead of traditional blockchains with predefined
block intervals and limited capacity. This parallelization allows for a scalable, composable multi-chain smart contract
network without the limitations of block intervals and limited block space. As a result, users can create smart contract
chains, anchor them securely and feelessly to the Shimmer network, and enable feeless, bridgeless interchain value
transfers between them.
