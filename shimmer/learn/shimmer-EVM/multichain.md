# Multi-Chain Environment

:::note tl;dr;

Shimmer enables a multi-chain environment where anyone can deploy their own smart contract chains and anchor them to the
L1 Shimmer network. This allows for parallel processing, [feeless](feeless.md) anchoring, and unlimited smart contract chains.

:::

## ShimmerEVM and Beyond

The ShimmerEVM is the first of many potential smart contract chains that can be anchored to the L1 Shimmer network. The
IOTA Foundation does not intend to run multiple smart contract chains, but Shimmer's permissionless and feeless
environment allows anyone to deploy their own smart contract chains and anchor them to the L1 Shimmer network.

### Anchoring and Transparency

State changes in smart contracts executed on these chains are logged on the underlying L1 Shimmer network in a feeless
fashion, allowing anyone to inspect and verify state changes happening in Layer 2 smart contract chains. This process is
called "anchoring."

Shimmer's parallel processing, as opposed to sequential processing in blockchains, makes information available instantly
and enables faster parallel processing. Developers can focus on their dApps without worrying about "how" and "when"
information is anchored and made available.

#### Key Features

- Parallel processing instead of predefined block intervals with limited block space.
- No fee bidding wars to be included in the next block.
- Secure anchor for unlimited smart contract chains, allowing for a multi-chain environment.
- Feeless anchoring that secures smart contract execution by making changes or execution results transparent to anyone.

### Value in a Multi-Chain Environment

The Shimmer network has a powerful layer 1 tokenization framework, allowing anyone to mint, manage, melt, or burn
their custom layer 1 tokens and NFTs.
