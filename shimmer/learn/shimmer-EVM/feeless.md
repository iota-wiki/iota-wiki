# Create and Transfer Tokens Freely in the Shimmer Network

:::note tl;dr;
The Shimmer network enables you to create and transfer tokens without fees, simplifies bridging chains, and offers you
more control over fees, making it a powerful solution for managing digital assets.

## Feeless Token Creation and Transfers

One of the key features of the Shimmer network is its ability to create custom layer 1 tokens without fees. This feature
is particularly useful for transferring value between layer 2 smart contract chains anchored to the Shimmer network. For
example, the ShimmerEVM chain can wrap value into a custom layer 1 token and transfer it without fees to an address
controlled by another smart contract chain.

By eliminating the need to build, audit, and maintain dedicated bridges between smart contract chains, the Shimmer
network enables a frictionless and feeless flow of liquidity. This is beneficial for various use cases, including dApps,
smart contract-controlled stablecoins, and DAOs.

## Simplifying Chain Bridging with Shimmer Network

The Shimmer network acts as a "bridge" that connects all smart contract chains anchored to it. This eliminates the need
for individual bridges between chains and reduces the overall cost for smart contract chain owners and dApps.

By allowing trade between all chains, the Shimmer network also creates more economic opportunities. Additionally, you no
longer have to worry about losing money due to hacked bridges, as the Shimmer network removes the need for dedicated
bridges.

## More Control Over Fees on Shimmer Network

Smart contract chain owners have the ability to define execution and validation costs for smart contracts on L2 smart
contract chains like ShimmerEVM. This gives chain owners the freedom to create incentives for execution based on their
preferences.

Execution fees in any smart contract chain can be settled through the native $SMR token, a custom L1 Shimmer token, or
an L2 token created by the L2 smart contract chain itself. In the ShimmerEVM chain, execution fees are settled through
the $SMR token.
