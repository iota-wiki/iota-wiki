# Governance of the ShimmerEVM Chain

:::note tl;dr;
The ShimmerEVM chain initially uses Proof of Authority (PoA) with 12 validators chosen by the IOTA Foundation. Over
time, control will be handed over to the community, and the ShimmerEVM chain will transition to a more decentralized
model.

## Proof of Authority and Community Involvement

At its genesis, the ShimmerEVM chain will use Proof of Authority (PoA) with 12 validators, initially chosen by the IOTA
Foundation. Although the IOTA Foundation does not generally intend to operate smart contract chains, it has launched the
ShimmerEVM as a public chain to kickstart development and ensure high quality of service, availability, and reliability.

### Transitioning to Decentralized Governance

Over time, the IOTA Foundation plans to hand over control of the ShimmerEVM chain to the community. This will involve
transferring a supermajority of validators to community members. Eventually, the ShimmerEVM will either be replaced or
complemented by a fully decentralized version that does not rely on PoA.
