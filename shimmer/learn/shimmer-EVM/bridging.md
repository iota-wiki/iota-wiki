# Bridging: Connecting Universes with Shimmer Network

:::note tl;dr;
The Shimmer network allows you to create interconnected smart contract kingdoms with ease, enabling seamless and feeless
trading between them and eliminating the need for costly, unreliable bridges.

## Your Own Kingdom in a Sea of Opportunity

Most Layer 2 ecosystems require developers and users to commit to their specific rules and limitations. These ecosystems
are like isolated kingdoms, each with its own set of rules and challenges. Traditional methods of connecting these
kingdoms involve costly and hard-to-maintain bridges, which often fail with disastrous consequences.

The Shimmer network, on the other hand, offers a different approach. Instead of moats and drawbridges, Shimmer provides
omnidirectional hyperloops that connect every kingdom with all others. This creates a vast, interconnected network of
smart contract chains, enabling seamless communication and trading between them.

## Full Freedom and Control with Shimmer Network

The Shimmer network allows you to define and customize your own smart contract kingdom according to your preferences.
You can choose to keep your realm closed off, controlling access and routes available to users, or open it up for
trading with other kingdoms.

Shimmer serves as the infrastructure connecting all smart contract chains anchored to it. It functions as a universal
marketplace where everyone speaks the same language and accepts the same base currency. Best of all, trading on this
marketplace is [feeless](feeless.md), making it highly attractive for users.

For those who do not wish to create their own kingdom or deploy their own chain, the public ShimmerEVM chain offers an
easy alternative to participate in this interconnected universe.
