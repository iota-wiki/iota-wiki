# IOTA Solutions

The IOTA foundation maintains and develops a collection of solutions building on the Tangle.

## List of Solutions

- [Streams](/docs/participate/solutions/streams):  
Streams is an organizational tool for structuring and navigating secure data through the Tangle. Streams organizes data by ordering it in a uniform and interoperable structure.
- [Identity](/docs/participate/solutions/identity):  
The IOTA Identity framework implements the most common standards and patterns for Decentralized Identity in both a DLT agnostic and iota method specification manner.
- [Smart Contracts](/docs/participate/solutions/smart-contracts):  
The IOTA Smart Contract Protocol (ISCP) is the implementation of Smart Contracts on IOTA.
- [Access](/docs/participate/solutions/access):  
IOTA Access is an open-source framework used to build access control systems for smart devices. It is designed to work with any IoT resource, whether it's a vehicle, smart lock, or embedded sensor.
- [Stronghold](/docs/participate/solutions/stronghold):  
A library for secure secret handling and storage.
- [Oracles](/docs/participate/solutions/oracles):  
IOTA Oracles bring off-chain data to decentralized applications and smart contracts on the IOTA network.
