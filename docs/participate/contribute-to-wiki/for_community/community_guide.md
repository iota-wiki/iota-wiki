# Community Contributions Guide

This article is a slab. You could check our [style guide](https://github.com/iota-community/iota-wiki) in the meantime.

If you want to elaborate on a topic or fix a typo, there are buttons at the bottom of every article. You can edit a page with the built-in WYSIWYG editor, or plain Markdown editor on GitHub. This will submit your changes to the wiki's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/iota-community/iota-wiki) where the community would review and approve them. You can also submit a PR manually. In any case, you would need a GitHub account.
