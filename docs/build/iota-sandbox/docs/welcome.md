The IOTA Sandbox serves as a local network designed specifically for developers. 
It enables prototyping and testing of smart contracts, INX plugins, and Layer 1 applications within the IOTA ecosystem. 
This Sandbox offers a secure and isolated environment for developers to experiment and verify functionality prior to deploying in production settings.

It is not for creating production-ready networks.
