# Native NFT and ERC721

The IOTA L1 has functionality to create NFTs, also called native NFTs. To use these NFTs on L2, you have
a ERC20 contract called `ERC721NFTs`. The following guides will show you how to [mint your own L1 NFT from L2](mint-nft.md), and [register](register-nft.md) it in the `ERC721NFTs` contract, 
so it can be used like any other ERC721 NFT with some additional features.
