# How To Fund Your L2 Account

There are multiple types of assets available on both IOTA L1 and L2, here we discuss a few of them, and how to get them
onto L2.

## Fund an Ethereum Account on a IOTA Smart Contracts Chain

To send EVM transactions, you need to have an Ethereum address that owns tokens on the ISC chain (L2). These tokens will
be used to cover gas fees.

### Bloom Wallet

The most intuitive way to do this is using [Bloom wallet](https://bloomwallet.io/). Connect it to the network of your
choice, and you will be able to send base tokens from L1 to L2.
