# The ISC Magic Contract

[EVM and ISC are inherently very different platforms](../getting-started/compatibility.md).
Some EVM-specific actions (e.g., manipulating Ethereum tokens) are disabled, and EVM contracts can access ISC-specific
functionality through the \_[ISC Magic Contract](../reference/magic-contract.md)\_\_.

The Magic contract is an EVM contract deployed by default on every ISC chain, in the EVM genesis block, at
address `0x1074000000000000000000000000000000000000`.
The implementation of the Magic contract is baked-in in
the [`evm`](../reference/core-contracts/evm.md) [core contract](../reference/core-contracts/overview.md);
i.e. it is not a pure-Solidity contract.

The Magic contract has several methods, which are categorized into specialized
interfaces: `ISCSandbox`, `ISCAccounts`, `ISCUtil` and so on.
You can access these interfaces from any Solidity contract by importing
the [ISC library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@iota/iscmagic):

```sh
yarn add @iota/iscmagic
```

You can import it into your contracts like this:

```solidity
import "@iota/iscmagic/ISC.sol";
```

The Magic contract also provides proxy ERC20 contracts to manipulate ISC base
tokens and native tokens on L2.

## Call a Function

In the example below, `ISC.sandbox.getEntropy()` calls the
[`getEntropy`](https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp/blob/develop/packages/vm/core/evm/iscmagic/ISCSandbox.sol#L20)
method of the `ISCSandbox` interface, which, in turn,
calls [ISC Sandbox's](../explanations/sandbox.md) `GetEntropy`.

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.8.5;

import "@iota/iscmagic/ISC.sol";

contract MyEVMContract {
    event EntropyEvent(bytes32 entropy);

    // this will emit a "random" value taken from the ISC entropy value
    function emitEntropy() public {
        bytes32 e = ISC.sandbox.getEntropy();
        emit EntropyEvent(e);
    }
}
```
