## ShimmerEVM Testnet

<AddToMetaMaskButton {...Networks['testnet']} />

[The ShimmerEVM Testnet](https://explorer.evm.testnet.shimmer.network/) runs as a layer 2 on top
of the [Public Testnet](/build/networks-endpoints#public-testnet). This network uses ISC to facilitate
an Ethereum Virtual Machine and has an enshrined bridge to layer 1.
