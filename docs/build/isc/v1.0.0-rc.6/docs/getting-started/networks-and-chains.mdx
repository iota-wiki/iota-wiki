## ShimmerEVM Testnet

<AddToMetaMaskButton cfg={Networks['testnet'].evm} />

[The ShimmerEVM Testnet](https://explorer.evm.testnet.shimmer.network/) runs as a layer 2 on top
of the [Public Testnet](/build/networks-endpoints#public-testnet). This network uses ISC to facilitate
an Ethereum Virtual Machine and has an enshrined bridge to layer 1.

[core contracts](../reference/core-contracts/overview.md) deployed, as well as the
[Magic Contract](../reference/magic-contract/introduction.md).
