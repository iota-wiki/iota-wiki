# ShimmerEVM Testnet Quickstart Guide

This guide will help you quickly get started with the [ShimmerEVM Testnet](/build/networks-endpoints/#shimmerevm-testnet), where you can deploy and interact with EVM-compatible smart contracts.

## Prerequisites

- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension installed

## Setup MetaMask

Click this button:

<AddToMetaMaskButton cfg={EVMNetworks['shimmerevm-testnet']} />

:::tip

Please read [the MetaMask  section in the tools guide](tools.mdx#metamask) for a detailed guide.

## Get Testnet SMR Tokens

:::tip ShimmerEVM

If you want to fund your ShimmerEVM account, please refer to our [How To Get Funds guide](../how-tos/send-funds-from-L1-to-L2.mdx).

:::

1. Go to the [ShimmerEVM Testnet Toolkit](https://evm-toolkit.evm.testnet.shimmer.network/).
2. Connect your MetaMask wallet by clicking "Connect Wallet" or paste an EVM address.
3. Select the account you want to receive testnet SMR tokens.
4. Click "Send funds" to get testnet SMR tokens.

## Get Simulated Bridged Tokens

1. Go to the [ERC20 Simulated Token Faucet](https://evm-faucet.testnet.shimmer.network/).
2. Connect your MetaMask wallet by clicking "Connect Wallet".
3. Select the account you want to receive simulated bridged tokens.
4. Choose the desired token (fETH, fBTC, fUSDT, etc.) from the dropdown list.
5. Click "Submit" to get the selected simulated bridged tokens.

## Deploy and Interact with Smart Contracts

You can now use your testnet SMR tokens and simulated bridged tokens to deploy and interact with smart contracts on the [Public Testnet](/build/networks-endpoints/#public-testnet). Utilize popular development tools and frameworks, such as [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), or [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), to build, test, and deploy your smart contracts.

## Explore the Public Testnet

Visit the [Public Testnet Block Explorer](https://explorer.evm.testnet.shimmer.network/) to monitor the chain, track transactions, and explore deployed smart contracts.

## Additional Resources

- [GitHub issues page for Wasp](https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp/issues)
- [EVM toolkit](https://evm-toolkit.evm.testnet.shimmer.network/)
- [ERC20 simulated token faucet](https://evm-faucet.testnet.shimmer.network)
- [Firefly Shimmer](https://firefly.iota.org)

With this quickstart guide, you should now be able to set up and start exploring the [ShimmerEVM Testnet](/build/networks-endpoints/#shimmerevm-testnet). As you begin to deploy and interact with smart contracts, remember to provide feedback on any issues or improvements you discover to help make the ShimmerEVM even better. Happy developing!
