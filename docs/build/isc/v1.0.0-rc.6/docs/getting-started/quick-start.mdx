# EVM Testnets Quickstart Guide

This guide will help you quickly get started with our [EVM Testnets](/build/networks-endpoints), where you can deploy and interact with EVM-compatible smart contracts.

## Prerequisites

- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension installed

## Setup MetaMask

Click this button:

<MetamaskButtons/>

:::tip

Please read [the MetaMask  section in the tools guide](tools.mdx#metamask) for a detailed guide.

:::

## Get Testnet Tokens

:::tip Fund your testnet account

If you want to fund your EVM testnet account, please refer to our [How To Get Funds guide](../how-tos/send-funds-from-L1-to-L2.mdx).

:::

1. Go to the [IOTA EVM](https://evm-toolkit.evm.testnet.iotaledger.net) or [ShimmerEVM](https://evm-toolkit.evm.testnet.shimmer.network/) Testnet Toolkit.
2. Connect your MetaMask wallet by clicking "Connect Wallet" or paste an EVM address.
3. Select the account you want to receive testnet tokens.
4. Click "Send funds" to get testnet tokens.

## Get Simulated Bridged Tokens

:::info ShimmerEVM Testnet

The simulated bridged tokens are currently only available on the ShimmerEVM Testnet.

:::

1. Go to the [ERC20 Simulated Token Faucet](https://evm-faucet.testnet.shimmer.network/).
2. Connect your MetaMask wallet by clicking "Connect Wallet".
3. Select the account you want to receive simulated bridged tokens.
4. Choose the desired token (fETH, fBTC, fUSDT, etc.) from the dropdown list.
5. Click "Submit" to get the selected simulated bridged tokens.

## Deploy and Interact with Smart Contracts

You can now use your testnet tokens and simulated bridged tokens to deploy and interact with smart contracts on the testnets. Utilize popular development tools and frameworks, such as [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), or [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), to build, test, and deploy your smart contracts.

## Explore the Public Testnet

Visit the corresponding Testnet Block Explorer to monitor the chain, track transactions, and explore deployed smart contracts.

With this quickstart guide, you should now be able to set up and start exploring the [Testnet](/build/networks-endpoints). As you begin to deploy and interact with smart contracts, remember to provide feedback on any issues or improvements you discover to help make our EVM even better. Happy developing!
