:::warning EVM Compatibility

The ISC EVM layer is also designed to be as compatible as possible with existing Ethereum
[tools](../getting-started/tools.mdx) and functionalities. However, please make sure you have checked out the current
[properties and limitations](../getting-started/compatibility.md).

For example, there is a difference in the decimal precision of ether (18 decimal places) to MIOTA/SMR(6 decimal places).
