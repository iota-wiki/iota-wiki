# ShimmerEVM Exchange Integration

If you already support EVM, then you probably are already familiar with what you'll need to integrate ShimmerEVM. As
with most networks, you should be able to use the same [JSON RPC API](https://wiki.iota.org/wasp-evm/reference/json-rpc-spec/) or clients, like [go-ethereum](https://geth.ethereum.org/), taking into account the
[compatibility and limitations](../getting-started/compatibility.md), use the ShimmerEVM RPC
URL (https://json-rpc.evm.shimmer.network) and ChainId (<ChainId url='https://json-rpc.evm.shimmer.network'/>), or set up your own [Hornet](/hornet/welcome/) node with the [Wasp](/wasp/running-a-node/) INX-plugin and get peered with the existing ShimmerEVM network.

## Running a Hornet Node with Wasp

### Install Hornet

The easiest way to get your [Hornet](/hornet/welcome/) node up and running is using the
provided [Docker image](/hornet/how_tos/using_docker/) which already includes the [Wasp](/wasp/running-a-node/)
INX-plugin.

### Post-Install Tasks

After you have [installed your node](#install-hornet), you should make sure you:

* [Configure Hornet's HTTP REST API](/hornet/how_tos/post_installation/#configuring-http-rest-api) to operate securely.
* Review the configuration options for both
[Hornet](/hornet/references/configuration/) and [Wasp](/wasp/configuration/).
* [Add peers to your node](/hornet/references/peering/).

### Interact with the ShimmerEVM Chain

You can use [`wasp-cli`](/wasp-cli/how-tos/wasp-cli/) to safely interact with
and [manage](wasp-cli/how-tos/chain-management/) your Wasp instance.

## Creating Transactions

ShimmerEVM handles transactions in the same way as standard EVM transaction with minor exceptions:

- They must be signed with ShimmerEVM's ChainID (<ChainId url='https://json-rpc.evm.shimmer.network'/>).
- The used EVM gas is converted to ISC gas before being charged to the sender.
- EVM contracts can't receive on-ledger requests.

:::warning Compatibility

Please make sure that you review
the [EVM Compatibility in IOTA Smart Contracts guide](../getting-started/compatibility.md#on-ledger-requests).

:::

### Determining Finality

[Block times are variable in ShimmerEVM](../getting-started/compatibility.md#no-enforced-block-time). A new EVM "block"
will be created only when an ISC block is created, and ISC does not enforce an average block time. This means that block
times are variable; a new block will be created as soon as needed. The average block time is 2.8 seconds.

## Tooling

ShimmerEVM is [compatible with most wallet and tools](../getting-started/compatible-tools.md) used
in EVM, such as [Metamask](../getting-started/compatible-tools.md#metamask), [Remix](../getting-started/compatible-tools.md#remix),
[Hardhat](../getting-started/compatible-tools.md#hardhat) and [Ethers.js](../getting-started/compatible-tools.md#ethersjsweb3js).

:::info ShimmerEVM Testnet

The [ShimmerEVM Testnet](/build/networks-endpoints/#testnet-evm) is a great way to develop and test your integration
without incurring in any risks or costs.

:::

## On-Chain Data

ShimmerEVM support any standard way of consuming on-chain data you use for any other EVM network.

## Oracle Support

The ShimmerEVM network supports [Oracles](/build/oracles/) to retrieve data from outside the contract's sandbox, such as
[Pyth](/build/oracles#pyth) and [Supra](/build/oracles#supra).

## FAQs

### What is the GitHub Address For the Network?

SMR is the native gas token on ShimmerEVM and therefore has no GitHub repository. You can
find [Hornet](https://github.com/iotaledger/hornet) and [Wasp](https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp) in
the [IOTA Ledger GitHub](https://github.com/iotaledger/).

### What Are the Hardware Requirements for Running a Node?

You can find a detailed list of requirements in
the [Hornet documentation](/hornet/getting_started/#recommended-requirements).

### What's the Precision of Each Transaction (i.g 0.0001)?

ShimmerEVM has the standard 18 decimals.

### How Can I Customize RPC Port and the Directory of Block Data?

The JSON RPC will be available by default on
`<NODE_HOST>/wasp/api/v1/chains/smr1prxvwqvwf7nru5q5xvh5thwg54zsm2y4wfnk6yk56hj3exxkg92mx20wl3s/evm`

You can route it however you wish using a proxy or any other stander tool for the task.

### What is the RPC/SDK API?

ShimmerEVM's RPC implements standard [JSON RPC API](../reference/json-rpc-spec.md).

### How can I Access the Balance of an Account?

You can use the standard EVM way using the RPC.

### How can I Recover an Account?

You can use any standard approach, as with Metamask for example.

### Which Wallets are Officially Recognized?

You can use any standard EVM compatible wallet such as [Metamask](https://metamask.io/),
or [Firefly](/get-started/wallets/firefly/) and [Bloom](/get-started/wallets/bloom/).

### Do the Nodes Use PoW?

No, Hornet and Wasp nodes use

### Is There a Timeout Mechanism for a Transaction in TX Pool? How Long Does It Take?

Yes, 15min

### Are There Any Rent or Reservation Costs?

Though there are no fixed costs, you should consider that you may have to
use [storage deposits](/learn/protocols/stardust/core-concepts/storage-deposit/).

### Is the Network Ready To Receive Transfers? If Not, When Will it Be?

The [Shimmer MainNet](/build/networks-endpoints/#shimmer) started on September 28, 2022.

### Does the Wallet Node Need to Expose Its Port? If So, if the Machine With Nat IP Is Ok?

You need to expose at least one peering port to be reachable from the outside; everything else can be closed.

### Do the Addresses Follow a Particular Ruleset?

Shimmer EVM can use the standard EVM account address (0x...).

### Is It Necessary to Add Our Node IP Into Your Whitelist When Synchronizing?

Yes, we need your IP to pair the nodes.
