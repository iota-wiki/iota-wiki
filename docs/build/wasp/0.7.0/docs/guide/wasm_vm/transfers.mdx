# Token Transfers

There are two methods in the [Call Context](context.mdx) that deal with token balances.
The first one is the `balances()` method, which can be used to determine the current asset
balances that are governed by this smart contract. The second one is the `allowance()`
method, which can be used to determine the caller assets that the current call to the
smart contract function is allowed to use.

Both methods provide access to zero or more balances of assets, through a special
`ScBalances` proxy. Note that the `allowance()` balances are not automatically transferred
to the smart contract but instead will need to explicitly be transferred by the function.
That way, if a function cannot handle the transfer the tokens will stay safely in the
caller's on-chain account. The function explicitly transfers only assets it understands,
and only in the amount that its algorithm defines, and never more than the allowed amount.

There is also a `transfer_allowed()` method in the [Call Context](context.mdx) that can
transfer assets from the caller's on-chain account to any other on-chain account. The
assets to be transferred are provided to the method through a special `ScTransfer` proxy,
which is essentially a mutable version of `ScBalances`. We will be using the
`transfer_allowed()` method in the `dividend` example to disperse the incoming iotas to
the member accounts.

The idea behind the dividend smart contract is that once we have set up the list of
members, consisting of address/factor pairs, and knowing the total sum of the factors, we
can automatically pay out a dividend to each of the members in the list according to the
factors involved. Whatever amount of iotas gets sent to the `divide()` function will be
divided over the members in proportion based on their respective factors. For example, you
could set it up so that address A has a factor of 50, B has 30, and C has 20, for a total
of 100 to divide. Then whenever an amount of iotas gets sent to the `divide()` function,
address A will receive 50/100th, address B will receive 30/100th, and address C will
receive 20/100th of that amount.

Here is the `divide` function:
