# Thunk Functions

In computer programming, a thunk is a wrapper function that is used to inject code around
another function. Thunks are used to insert operations before and/or after the wrapped
function is being called to adapt it to changing requirements. The
[Schema Tool](usage.mdx) will generate such thunk functions to be able to properly set up
calls to the smart contract functions. It also creates a mapping between the name/id of
the function and the actual function, and generates code to properly communicate this
mapping to the ISC host.

In our case we use thunks not only to inject code around the smart contract function, but
also to make the smart contract function type-safe. The thunks all have an identical
function signature, and each will set up a function-specific data structure so that the
actual smart contract function will deal with them in a type-safe way. Having a common
function signature for the thunks means that it is easy to generate a table of all
functions and their names that can be used to generically call these functions.

All code for this table and the thunks is generated as part of `lib.xx` and it looks as
follows for the `dividend` example smart contract (for simplicity the thunk function
contents has been omitted for now):

The key function here is the `OnDispatch()` function, which will be called by the main
Wasm file. This main Wasm file is separate because the Wasm runtime format is
essentially a dynamic link library. That means it not only defined exported functions,
but also defines functions it needs to link to at a later stage, and which will be
provided by the Wasm VM host.

We want to keep the SC code separate as a self-contained library that is independent of
the Wasm format requirements, because we will be reusing the same SC code in client-side
code that can directly execute SC requests through this same interface.

The Wasm host requires us to implement the `on_load()`and `on_call()` Wasm callback
functions. These will directly dispatch these calls through the corresponding
`OnDispatch()` function in the generated `lib.xx`.

The `on_load()` Wasm function will be called by the Wasm VM host upon loading of the Wasm
code. It will inform the host of all the function ids and types (Func or View) that this
smart contract provides.

When the host needs to call a function of the smart contract it will call the `on_call()`
callback function with the corresponding function id, and then the `on_call()` function
will dispatch the call via the `ScExportMap` mapping table that was generated by the
[Schema Tool](usage.mdx) to the proper associated thunk function.

This Wasm-specific code has been separated out in `main.xx`, as a separate package next
to the SC library. For Rust it is a little more complex, so it has been separated out to
a folder with the same name, followed by `wasm`. The `src/lib.rs` file serves the same
function as the `main.xx` file in the other languages.

The Wasm-specific code will also make sure that the WasmVMHost code will be pulled into
the Wasm code because that defines the missing import functions that will be provided
by the Wasm VM host. In this way we manage to make WasmLib independent of the Wasm code
format as well. WasmLib defines an `ScHost` interface that will define what host
environment is used, which in this case is `WasmVMHost`. For the client-side code we
implement a different `ScHost` that hides the differences.

Here is the generated `main.xx` that forms the main entry point for the Wasm code:

Finally, here is an example implementation of a thunk function for the `setOwner()`
contract function. You can examine the other thunk functions that all follow the same
pattern in the generated `lib.xx`:

First, the thunk logs the contract and function name to show that the call has started.
Then it sets up a strongly typed function-specific context structure. First, we add the
function-specific immutable [Params](params.mdx) interface structure, which is only
present when the function actually can have parameters. Then we add the contract-specific
[State](state.mdx) interface structure. In this case it is mutable because setOwner is a
[Func](funcs.mdx). For [Views](views.mdx) this would be an immutable state interface.
Finally, we would add the function-specific mutable [Results](results.mdx) interface
structure, which is only present when the function actually returns results. Obviously,
this is not the case for this `setOwner()` function.

Next it sets up access control for the function according to the schema definition file.
In this case it retrieves the `owner` state variable through the function context,
requires that the variable exists, and then requires that the `caller()` of the function
equals that value. Any failing requirement will panic out of the thunk function with an
error message. So this code makes sure that only the owner of the contract can call this
function.

Now we get to the point where we can use the function-specific [Params](params.mdx)
interface to check for mandatory parameters. Each mandatory parameter is required to
exist, or else we will panic out of the thunk function with an error message.

With the setup and automated checks completed, we now call the actual smart contract
function implementation that is maintained by the user. After this function has completed,
we would process the returned results for those functions that have any (in this case we
obviously don't have results), and finally we log that the contract function has completed
successfully. Remember that any error within the user function will cause a panic, so this
logging will never occur in case that happens.

In the next section we will look at the specifics of [view functions](views.mdx).
