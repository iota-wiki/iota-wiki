# Create and Validate Verifiable Presentations

The IOTA Identity Framework enables holders tos easily construct
[verifiable presentations](./../../explanations/verifiable-presentations.mdx).
As demonstrated in the [example](#example),
holders only need to pass in their credentials to present and sign the presentation.

## Properties

You can specify the following properties in a presentation:

- [**ID**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#identifiers): Optional URI identifier for the presentation.
- [**Context**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#contexts): List of JSON-LD context URIs. Includes `"https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"` by default.
- [**Types**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#types): List of types describing the presentation. Includes `"VerifiablePresentation"` by default.
- [**Credentials**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifiable-credentials): List of verifiable credentials to present.
- [**Holder**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-holders): Optional URI, typically a DID, of the entity that generated the presentation.
- [**Refresh Service**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#refreshing): Optional link to a service where the recipient may refresh the included credentials.
- [**Terms of Use**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#terms-of-use): Optional list of policies defining obligations, prohibitions, or permissions of the presentation recipient.

Of the above, **only the list of credentials is required** when creating a presentation using the framework.
However, the holder property should be included to satisfy [subject-holder relationship](#subject-holder-relationship) checks during validation.

After creation, the holder signs the verifiable presentation using a private key linked to one of the verification
methods in their DID Document and transmits it to a verifier for validation.

## Proof Options

A digital signature on a verifiable presentation provides data integrity,
and also proves the [DID](../../explanations/decentralized-identifiers.mdx) of the holder.

### Metadata Properties

The proof section embedded in a presentation may also include additional metadata.

The following metadata properties can be configured by the framework and are optional and omitted by default:

- **Created**: Timestamp of when the presentation was signed.
- **Expires**: Timestamp after which the presentation is no longer considered valid.
- **Challenge**: Arbitrary random string. Sent by the verifier and mitigates replay attacks; should be sufficiently random and uniquely generated per presentation request.
- **Domain**: Arbitrary string. Sent by the verifier and can help mitigate replay attacks when used with a challenge.
- **Proof Purpose**: Indicates the purpose of the signature.
  - **AssertionMethod**: To assert a claim. The signing verification method must have an [`assertionMethod`](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#assertion) relationship to be valid.
  - **Authentication**: To authenticate the signer. The signing verification method must have an [`authentication`](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#authentication) relationship to be valid.

:::note

Verifiers should always send a challenge and domain
to [mitigate replay attacks](./../../explanations/verifiable-presentations.mdx#security-considerations).

:::

A verifier could also choose to ignore some or all of these options.
See [Proof Verifier Options](#proof-verifier-options) for more information.

## Validation

The IOTA Identity Framework provides several options for verifiers to validate various sections of a verifiable presentation.
See the [example](#example) for a demonstration of how to validate a presentation.

The framework checks:

- **Semantic structure**: Ensures the presentation and its credentials adhere to the specification.
- **Presentation proof**: Verifies the presentation signature against the DID Document of the holder.
- **Credential proofs**: Verifies the credential signatures against the DID Documents of their respective issuers.
- **Optional validations**: Additional checks on signatures and credential fields can be configured by the verifier.

Note that a verifier may specify which DID Documents to use for the holder and issuers.
Otherwise, they are resolved from the Tangle automatically.

Currently, the following are **not** checked automatically:

- **Data schemas**: Credentials that specify a [schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#data-schemas) property
should be examined to ensure conformance.
- **Fitness for purpose**: Whether the credentials in a presentation and the data within them are acceptable and
valid depends on the context in which they are used. Verifiers should ensure that the credential types, subjects,
and schemas sent by a holder match what was requested.
- **Issuer trustworthiness**: Verifiers must check that they trust the issuer on each individual credential in a
presentation. The framework only verifies that the issuer's signature on each credential is current and valid
against the given options.

The default validation behavior may be modified by the following options.

### Proof Verifier Options

While the framework always verifies that the digital signature on a verifiable presentation is valid,
a verifier may validate additional fields in the proof on a presentation.
Notably, to mitigate potential [replay attacks](./../../explanations/verifiable-presentations.mdx#security-considerations),
a verifier should always check that the challenge and domain fields match what was sent to the holder when
requesting the presentation.

The following options are available:

- **Method Scope**: check the signing verification method has a particular [verification relationship](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#verification-relationships). Overridden by the proof purpose check.
- **Method Type**: check the signing verification method has a particular type.
- **Challenge**: check the challenge field matches this string.
- **Domain**: check the domain field matches this string.
- **Proof Purpose**: require a specific purpose on the proof. See [Proof Options](#proof-options).
- **Allow Expired**: accept proofs where the current datetime is after their expiration. Default is to reject expired proofs.

See [Proof Options](#proof-options) for more information on setting these properties as a holder when signing a verifiable presentation.

## Subject-Holder Relationship

Specifies the expected relationship between the holder that signed the verifiable presentation and the subject
specified in each [verifiable credential](./../../explanations/verifiable-credentials.mdx).
This can be restricted by the [`nonTransferable`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#nontransferable-property) property,
which indicates that a verifiable credential must only be encapsulated into a verifiable presentation whose holder matches the credential subject.

By default, the framework always enforces that the holder matches the subject on all credentials.

The following options are available to modify that behavior:

- **`AlwaysSubject` (default)**: The holder DID that signed the presentation must match the [`credentialSubject` `id`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#credential-subject) field in each of the attached credentials. This is the safest option which ensures holders may only present credentials that were directly issued to their DID. An error is thrown on a mismatch or if no subject `id` is present.
- **`SubjectOnNonTransferable`**: The holder DID must match the subject only for credentials where the [`nonTransferable`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#nontransferable-property) property is `true`. This is appropriate for accepting [bearer credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#bearer-credentials) while still adhering to the specification.
- **`Any`**: The holder DID is not required to have any kind of relationship to any credential subject. This option performs no checks and ignores the [`nonTransferable`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#nontransferable-property) property.

:::note

See the [Verifiable Credentials Data Model Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#subject-holder-relationships)
for further discussion on the different subject-holder relationships.

### Credential Validation Options

These options specify conditions that all credentials in a verifiable presentation must satisfy.

- **Expiry Date**: Check that the [`expirationDate`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#expiration) property, if present, is not before a specific datetime. Defaults to the current datetime if unset.
- **Issuance Date**: Check that the [`issuanceDate`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#issuance-date) property, if present, is not after a specific datetime. Defaults to the current datetime if unset.
- **Verifier Options**: See [Proof Verifier Options](#proof-verifier-options) for details.

## Example Code

The following code demonstrates how to use the IOTA Identity Framework end-to-end to create and sign a verifiable
presentation as a holder, serialize it to JSON for transmission, deserialize it on the receiving side as a verifier,
and finally validate it with various options.
