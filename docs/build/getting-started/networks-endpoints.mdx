# Networks & Endpoints

This pages gives an overview around the different networks available in the IOTA ecosystem.

:::info
In general, all endpoints are load balanced but are also subject to rate limiting.
If you are developing a production level application for IOTA, consider setting up your own infrastructure in order to
have more control and to not run into any limits.

## IOTA

[The IOTA Mainnet](https://explorer.iota.org/mainnet) is the production network within the IOTA ecosystem using the IOTA
token.

:::info

This network runs under a [Coordinator PoA scheme](/learn/protocols/coordinator/) with validators operated by [Akkodis](https://www.akkodis.com), [ETO GRUPPE](https://www.etogruppe.com/), [Software AG](https://softwareag.com/), [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk) and the IOTA Foundation.

### IOTA EVM

[IOTA EVM](https://explorer.evm.iota.org) is the L2 EVM running on top of the IOTA network.

<NetworkInfo.Evm {...Networks['iota']}/>

#### Additional Info

<NetworkInfo.EvmCustom {...Networks['iota']}/>

## IOTA Testnet

[The IOTA Testnet](https://explorer.iota.org/iota-testnet) acts as a test bed for builders without any real world value.

:::info
This network is subject to occasional resets (no data retention) which are usually announced with a one-week grace period.
:::

<NetworkInfo.L1 {...Networks['iota_testnet']} />

### IOTA EVM Testnet

[IOTA EVM Testnet](https://explorer.evm.testnet.iotaledger.net) is the L2 EVM running on top of the IOTA Testnet network.

:::info

This network is subject to occasional resets (no data retention) which are usually announced with a one-week grace period.

## Shimmer

[Shimmer](https://explorer.iota.org/shimmer) is the staging network for new protocol versions before they hit IOTA
Mainnet.

<NetworkInfo.L1 {...Networks['shimmer']} />

### ShimmerEVM

[ShimmerEVM](https://explorer.evm.shimmer.network/) is the L2 EVM running on top of the Shimmer network.

<AddToMetaMaskButton {...Networks['shimmer']} />

<NetworkInfo.Evm {...Networks['shimmer']} />

#### Additional Info

<NetworkInfo.EvmCustom {...Networks['shimmer']} />

## Shimmer Testnet

[The Shimmer Testnet](https://explorer.shimmer.network/shimmer-testnet) acts as a test bed for builders without any real world value.

:::info
This network is subject to occasional resets (no data retention) which are usually announced with a one-week grace period.

<NetworkInfo.L1 {...Networks['shimmer_testnet']} />

### ShimmerEVM Testnet

<AddToMetaMaskButton {...Networks['shimmer_testnet']} />

[The ShimmerEVM Testnet](https://explorer.evm.testnet.shimmer.network/) runs as a layer 2 on top
of the Shimmer Testnet. This network uses ISC to facilitate an Ethereum Virtual Machine and has an
enshrined bridge to layer 1.

:::info

This network is subject to occasional resets (no data retention) which are usually announced with a one-week grace period.

## IOTA 2.0 Testnet

[The IOTA 2.0 Testnet](https://explorer.iota.org/iota2-testnet) acts as a test bed for builders without any real world value.

:::info

This network is subject to occasional resets (no data retention) which are usually announced with a one-week grace period.
