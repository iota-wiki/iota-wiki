# Blast API

[Blast API](https://blastapi.io/) is a decentralized platform that provides reliable and scalable node infrastructure
for accessing blockchain data. It supports multiple blockchain networks, offering seamless integration and 
high-performance API endpoints for cross-chain decentralized applications (dApps).

## Enhanced Performance and Reliability

Blast API uses a decentralized network of third-party node providers, that ensure high availability and fast response
times. This architecture provides resilient infrastructure services crucial for dApps requiring real-time data access.

## Multi-Blockchain Support

Besides IOTA EVM, Blast API supports a wide range of blockchain networks, allowing access to multiple blockchains 
through a single unified platform, therefore simplifying the development process and expanding the potential use cases 
for dApps.

## Archival Nodes

Blast API includes archival nodes, which store all historical transaction data from the blockchainâ€™s
genesis block to the present. This allows developers to query and retrieve past information, which is essential for
applications needing access to comprehensive blockchain histories.
