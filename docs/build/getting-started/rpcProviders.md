# RPC Providers

Professional RPC providers provide highly optimized RPC endpoints, including services like Archival Nodes, which store all historical transaction data from the blockchainâ€™s genesis block to the present. This allows developers to query and retrieve past information, which is essential for applications needing access to comprehensive blockchain histories. They also often support a wide range of blockchain networks, allowing access to multiple blockchains 
through a single unified platform, therefore simplifying the development process and expanding the potential use cases 
for dApps.

:::tip Endpoints

You can find a complete list of (archival) endpoints in the [Networks & Endpoints section](networks-endpoints.mdx).

## Ankr

[Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/web3-api/) is a well-established industry player known for its enterprise-grade globally distributed infrastructure of nodes and for the largest number of chains on the market to support your requests.

## Blast

[Blast API](https://blastapi.io/) is a decentralized platform that provides reliable and scalable node infrastructure
for accessing blockchain data. It supports multiple blockchain networks, offering seamless integration and 
high-performance API endpoints for cross-chain decentralized applications (dApps).
