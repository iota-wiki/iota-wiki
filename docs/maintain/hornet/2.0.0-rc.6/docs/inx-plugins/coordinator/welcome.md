# Welcome to INX-Coordinator

INX-Coordinator is the extension tasked with coordinating the constant grow of the tangle.
It's task is to issue milestones at a constant rate. Validation of the issued milestones is done by the nodes.

## Setup

There is only one coordinator needed in a network. If you want to run your own private network with it's own coordinator, have a look at our [Run a Private Tangle](/hornet/2.0.0-rc.6/how_tos/private_tangle) guide.

## Configuration

The coordinator is configured by default to connect to your HORNET instance.

You can find all the configuration options in the [configuration section](configuration.md).

## Source Code

The source code of the project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/iotaledger/inx-coordinator).
