# Digital Assets

content - introduction to the topic

## Types of Digital Assets

The umbrella term for all assets on IOTA is **digital assets**.

These assets may exist on Layer 1 (the IOTA mainnet, as customized IOTA tokens), or on Layer 2 (within smart contract chains). To differentiate these asset classes we use two different names:

*   Layer 1 assets are termed **native assets**, as they are native to the IOTA mainnet.
*   Layer 2 assets are termed **smart assets**, as these exist on the smart contract layer, and have greater programmability.

The process of creating either type of digital asset is known as **minting.**

*Notes:*\
*The terms asset and token may be used interchangeably (i.e. native asset, native token, smart asset, smart token). For example, if you are referring to a piece of artwork, you would probably call it an asset, but if you are referring to WenCoin, you would probably call it a token.*
