content - introduction to the topic


## IOTA 2.0 Decentralized DevNet

The implementation of the upcoming fully decentralized IOTA 2.0 Protocol. The network here does not use or need a coordinator anymore. Utilizes Testnet iota tokens without value to fine-tune, test and optimize the upcoming development stage of the IOTA Protocol together with the IOTA community. This network is comprised of Goshimmer nodes. While a large portion of nodes in the 2.0 Devnet is run and maintained by the Iota foundation, anyone can contribute by running nodes of their own. Having a larger network is benefitial for testing of newly researched and developed concepts and ideas as well as catching bugs and ironing out finished components.
