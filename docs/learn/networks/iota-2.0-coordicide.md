# IOTA 2.0 Coordicide

## Vision

The vision of a fully decentralized, feeless and highly scalable DLT.

IOTA has always worked towards solving the big goal in Crypto. Solving the Blockchain Trilemma and creating a network that is permissionless, trustless, totally decentralized, easily accessible for everyone, blazing fast, extremely secure, leaderless, scalable, ready for mass adoption. The goal is to reach this without sacrificing one of the three major points: security, scalability, decentralization.

## Testnet implementation
Over the last couple of years, IOTA has put an immense amount of research in developing a network that can be all the above described, and currently, this network is live in the [GoShimmer network](https://wiki.iota.org/goshimmer/welcome)

This network has been live since the beginning of 2020 and is the testbed for all research implementations that aim to improve the approach to bring this technology finally to the IOTA Mainnet and remove the Coordinator node. More and more maturity has been reached as described in this [blog.](https://blog.iota.org/path-towards-full-decentralization-with-iota-2-0/)

The IOTA Research Team test all Coordicide components together with the community in this public Testnet. Everyone can participate, [spin up a node](https://wiki.iota.org/goshimmer/tutorials/setup) in the network, test the solutions, and support the research.

Step by step, the technology is improving, and the [IOTA Research Team](https://wiki.iota.org/docs/learn/research/research-outline) has used this network to produce a huge amount of [scientific papers](https://wiki.iota.org/docs/learn/research/research-papers) that go through full peer review processes ensuring the mathematical validation of all implemented solutions.

A great summary of the research can be found in this collection of videos recorded with internationally renowned scientists at the IOTA Research Symposium that took place in August 2021

A Website that gives the most recent information, links to the relevant research papers and specifications has been created:
 - [IOTA V2 DevNet](https://v2.iota.org/)

You will find all the needed information on this website, observe the network live using the [visualizer](https://v2.iota.org/visualizer), and find all related research papers and specifications.

Currently, the network undergoes a big upgrade as some major breakthroughs have been made and new components will be added and tested to find the final form and solution towards implementing the technology on the IOTA Mainnet. Read more in this blogpost:
