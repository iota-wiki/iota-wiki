# IOTA Token

:::note tl;dr
The IOTA token enables value transfer between humans and machines, with fair distribution and reasonable funding. It is
supported by a non-profit foundation and designed for feeless transactions, opening up unique use cases in the digital
economy.
:::

The IOTA token is a powerful tool for value transfer between humans and machines.

## Fair Distribution

Since its genesis, it has been important for the IOTA token to be created fairly. There were **no locked tokens**, **no early
corporate investors**, and **no tokens were awarded to founders**.

## A Non-Profit Foundation

The IOTA Foundation is a non-profit organization. This gives the IOTA token more trust and value. It ensures we can
achieve our vision of creating an open-source, standardized protocol for the world.

## Designed For The Long Haul

The IOTA token is a powerful digital asset. There are no miners. This means value and data can be transacted
without any fees, enabling a variety of use cases no other digital asset can.
