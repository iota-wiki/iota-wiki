# Shimmer: IOTA's Staging Network for Tokenization and Smart Contracts

Shimmer, the staging network of IOTA, serves as a crucial testing ground for new advancements before deployment on
the IOTA network. Shimmer focuses on innovation and provides a platform for testing cutting-edge features such as
tokenization and smart contracts.

## Shimmer: A Canary Network for Innovation

Shimmer acts as a canary network for the IOTA ecosystem, allowing developers and enthusiasts to experiment with emerging
technologies. It is a testing environment where new features are introduced and evaluated for
functionality, scalability, and security. Shimmer's primary goal is to identify and refine innovations that will
eventually be implemented on the main IOTA network.

## Tokenization on Shimmer

Tokenization is a key feature of Shimmer, enabling the creation and management of custom tokens on the network. Through
In Shimmer's tokenization framework, users can create non-fungible tokens (NFTs), native tokens, and alias outputs. These
tokenization capabilities provide a foundation for various use cases, including digital assets, decentralized finance
(DeFi), and supply chain management. By experimenting with tokenization on Shimmer, developers can explore the
possibilities and refine the implementation of these features before they are introduced to the wider IOTA network.

## Smart Contracts on Shimmer

Another crucial aspect of Shimmer is its support for smart contracts. Smart contracts facilitate the execution of
self-executing agreements without the need for intermediaries. Shimmer offers the ability to develop and deploy smart
contracts using the IOTA Smart Contracts (ISC) framework. ISC provides developers with a scalable and flexible
environment to create and interact with smart contracts on the IOTA ecosystem. Additionally, Shimmer supports Ethereum
Virtual Machine (EVM) smart contracts through the EVM core contract. This interoperability expands the possibilities for
developers and opens up opportunities for integrating existing Ethereum-based projects with the IOTA network.

## Shimmer Devnet: Stability for Decentralized Applications and Smart Contracts

To ensure the stability and reliability of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, Shimmer features a
dedicated development network known as the Shimmer Devnet. The Shimmer Devnet provides a controlled environment for
developers to test their applications and contracts under real-world conditions. This network mimics the main Shimmer
network, allowing developers to evaluate the performance and behavior of their projects before deploying them to the
Shimmer Mainnet. By utilizing the Shimmer Devnet, developers can identify and address any potential issues or
vulnerabilities, ensuring a smoother transition to the production-ready Shimmer Mainnet.

## Embracing Innovation with Shimmer

Shimmer represents a significant step forward for the IOTA ecosystem, providing a dedicated platform for testing and
refining new features. Shimmer enables developers to explore the full
potential of these technologies within the IOTA network by focusing on tokenization and smart contracts. Developers can ensure the stability
and reliability of their decentralized applications and smart contracts through the Shimmer Devnet before launching them on the Shimmer Mainnet. As
Shimmer continues to evolve; it will catalyze innovation, driving the growth and adoption of the IOTA
ecosystem.
