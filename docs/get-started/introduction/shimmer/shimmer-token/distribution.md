# Shimmer Token Distribution

The distribution of Shimmer tokens is an important aspect of the Shimmer network ecosystem. Here is a breakdown of how
the initial supply of Shimmer tokens is allocated:

## Shimmer Genesis Supply

The Shimmer Genesis Supply consists of 1,813,620,509 SMR tokens. These tokens form the foundation of the Shimmer network
and are available from the start.

## IOTA Stakers 80%

A significant portion of the Shimmer tokens, accounting for 80% of the total supply, is allocated to IOTA stakers. This
amounts to 1,450,896,407 SMR tokens. IOTA token holders who stake their tokens have the opportunity to receive Shimmer
tokens as rewards for their participation in the network.

## Community DAO 10%

To foster community involvement and governance, 10% of the Shimmer token supply, equivalent to 181,362,051 SMR tokens,
is dedicated to the Community DAO. This allocation ensures that community members have a voice in decision-making and
can contribute to the development and growth of the Shimmer ecosystem.

## Tangle Ecosystem 10%

Another 10% of the Shimmer token supply, totaling 181,362,051 SMR tokens, is designated for the Tangle Ecosystem. This
allocation aims to support and incentivize projects and initiatives that leverage the IOTA Tangle and contribute to the
overall ecosystem's development.

The distribution of Shimmer tokens across these categories aims to create a balanced and inclusive network, promoting
participation, community engagement, and innovation within the Shimmer ecosystem.
